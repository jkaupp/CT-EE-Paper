In this paper six assessment approaches, which include standardized instruments (Collegiate Learning Assessment Plus, Critical Thinking Assessment Test, Cornell Critical Thinking Test and the International Critical Thinking Test), Meta-rubrics (VALUE Rubrics), and an approach utilizing model eliciting activities.
