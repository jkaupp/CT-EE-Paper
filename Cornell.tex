\subsubsection{The Cornell Critical Thinking Test}

The Cornell Critical Thinking Test Level Z (CCTT) is a 52-item, multiple choice test. The CCTT measures aspects of critical thinking consistent with the Cornell-Illinois model organized into 5 categories/cite{Ennis:1985ut}:

1)	Induction
2)	Deduction
3)	Observation & Credibility
4)	Assumptions
5)	Meaning & Fallacies

The Cornell-Illinois model of critical thinking was developed and refined by Robert Ennis based on the following working definition of critical thinking:

\begin{quote}\textit{Critical thinking is reasonable and reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do} /cite{Ennis:1985ut}\end{quote}

The model, illustrated in Figure 1, is divided and sub-classified based on three modes of critical thought (induction, deduction and value judging) and four methods on which they are based: the results of inferences, observations, statements and assumptions. Lastly, the model is connected by a common thread of attention to meaning which is interwoven throughout the four methods and three elements/cite{Ennis:1985ut}.
