abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To relate the vertical striations visualized in the deeper layers of articular cartilage by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to histological features.

METHODS:Two knee joints recovered at post-mortem from males in their seventies with no history or visual evidence of joint disease were examined. MR images were obtained in a 4.7 T 400 mm-bore magnet, after which the knees were fixed, sectioned, and examined histologically.

RESULTS:High resolution MR showed vertical high/low signal striations with a two to three-fold variation in signal intensity and a periodicity of 0.56 (+/-0.16 mm), most prominent in weight bearing areas. Histological sections revealed alternating light and dark staining areas with a periodicity of 1.01+/-0.54 mm in the lower zones of the cartilage, some, but not all of which clearly represented folding. Given that MR will only visualize vertical structures in cartilage aligned at 90 degrees, whereas histology will cut them at varying angles, it is likely that the vertical structures seen by each modality correspond, and that they represent structural heterogeneity in cartilage; perhaps the presence of plates of high collagen and proteoglycan content.

CONCLUSION:The vertical striations seen routinely in the deep zones of hyaline articular cartilage on histological sections are not artefactual; they are likely to represent structural heterogeneity due to the presence of areas of high collagen and high proteoglycan content that exist in weight-bearing areas. This structural heterogeneity may be of great importance to the integrity and function of the cartilage.},

abstract = {Hyaline cartilage contains five well-characterized proteoglycans in its extracellular matrix, and it is likely that others exist. The largest in size and most abundant by weight is aggrecan, a proteoglycan that possesses over 100 chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate chains. Aggrecan is also characterized by its ability to interact with hyaluronic acid to form large proteoglycan aggregates. Both the high anionic charge on the individual aggrecan molecules endowed by the sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains and the localization within the matrix endowed by aggregate formation are essential for aggrecan function. The molecule provides cartilage with its osmotic properties, which give articular cartilage its ability to resist compressive loads. The other proteoglycans are characterized by their ability to interact with collagen. They are much smaller than aggrecan in size but may be present in similar molar amounts. Decorin, biglycan, and fibromodulin are closely related in protein structure but differ in glycosaminoglycan composition and function. Decorin and biglycan possess one and two dermatan sulfate chains, respectively, whereas fibromodulin bears several keratan sulfate chains. Decorin and fibromodulin both interact with the type II collagen fibrils in the matrix and may play a role in fibrillogenesis and interfibril interactions. Biglycan is preferentially localized in the pericellular matrix, where it may interact with type VI collagen. Finally, type IX collagen can also be considered as a proteoglycan, as its alpha 2(IX) chain may bear a glycosaminoglycan chain. It may serve as a bridge between the collagen fibrils or with the interspersed aggrecan network.},

abstract = {Promoting students{\textquoteright} critical thinking (CT) has been an essential goal of higher education. However, despite the various attempts to make CT a primary focus of higher education, there is little agreement regarding the conditions under which instruction could result in greater CT outcomes. In this review, we systematically examined current empirical evidence and attempted to explain why some instructional interventions result in greater CT gains than others. Thirty three empirical studies were included in the review and features of the interventions of those individual studies were analyzed. Emphasis was given to the study features related to CT instructional approach, teaching strategy, student and teacher related characteristics, and CT measurement. The findings revealed that effectiveness of CT instruction is influenced by conditions in the instructional environment comprising the instructional variables (teaching strategies and CT instructional approaches), and to some extent by student-related variables (year level and prior academic performance). Moreover, the type of CT measures adopted (standardized vs. non-standardized) appear to influence evaluation of the effectiveness of CT interventions. The findings overall indicated that there is a shift towards embedding CT instruction within academic disciplines, but failed to support effectiveness of particular instructional strategies in fostering acquisition and transfer of CT skills. The main limitation in the current empirical evidence is the lack of systematic design of instructional interventions that are in line with empirically valid instructional design principles.},

abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multi-factor disorder of sinovial joints, which characterized by escalated degeneration and loss of articular cartilage. Treatment of OA is a critical unmet need in medicine for regeneration of damaged articular cartilage in elderly. On the other hand, lubricin, a glycoprotein specifically synthesized by chondrocytes located at the surface of articular cartilage, has been shown to provide boundary lubrication of congruent articular surfaces under conditions of high contact pressure and near zero sliding speed. Lubrication of these surfaces is critical to normal joint function, while different gene expressions of lubricin had been found in the synovium of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and OA. Moreover, mutations or lacking of lubricin gene have been shown to link to the joint disease such as camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome (CACP), synovial hyperplasia and failure of joint function, suggesting an important role of lubricin in the pathogenesis of these joint disease. Recent studies demonstrate that administration with recombinant lubricin in the joint cavity would be effective in the prevention of cartilage degeneration in animal OA models. Therefore, a treatment with lubricin which would protect cartilage in vivo would be desirable. This article reviews recent findings with regard to the possible role of lubricin in the progression of OA, and further discusses lubricin as a novel potential biotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of OA.},

abstract = {The growth, maintenance and ossification of cartilage are fundamental to skeletal development and are regulated throughout life by the mechanical cues that are imposed by physical activities. Finite element computer analyses have been used to study the role of local tissue mechanics on endochondral ossification patterns, skeletal morphology and articular cartilage thickness distributions. Using single-phase continuum material representations of cartilage, the results have indicated that local intermittent hydrostatic pressure promotes cartilage maintenance. Cyclic tensile strains (or shear), however, promote cartilage growth and ossification. Because single-phase material models cannot capture fluid exudation in articular cartilage, poroelastic (or biphasic) solid/fluid models are often implemented to study joint mechanics. In the middle and deep layers of articular cartilage where poroelastic analyses predict little fluid exudation, the cartilage phenotype is maintained by cyclic fluid pressure (consistent with the single-phase theory). In superficial articular layers the chondrocytes are exposed to tangential tensile strain in addition to the high fluid pressure. Furthermore, there is fluid exudation and matrix consolidation, leading to cell 'flattening'. As a result, the superficial layer assumes an altered, more fibrous phenotype. These computer model predictions of cartilage mechanobiology are consistent with results of in vitro cell and tissue and molecular biology experiments.},

abstract = {Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is used widely as a treatment for symptomatic chondral and osteochondral defects of the knee. Variations of the original periosteum-cover technique include the use of porcine-derived type I/type III collagen as a cover (ACI-C) and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) using a collagen bilayer seeded with chondrocytes. We have performed a prospective, randomised comparison of ACI-C and MACI for the treatment of symptomatic chondral defects of the knee in 91 patients, of whom 44 received ACI-C and 47 MACI grafts. Both treatments resulted in improvement of the clinical score after one year. The mean modified Cincinnati knee score increased by 17.6 in the ACI-C group and 19.6 in the MACI group (p = 0.32). Arthroscopic assessments performed after one year showed a good to excellent International Cartilage Repair Society score in 79.2% of ACI-C and 66.6% of MACI grafts. Hyaline-like cartilage or hyaline-like cartilage with fibrocartilage was found in the biopsies of 43.9% of the ACI-C and 36.4% of the MACI grafts after one year. The rate of hypertrophy of the graft was 9% (4 of 44) in the ACI-C group and 6% (3 of 47) in the MACI group. The frequency of re-operation was 9% in each group. We conclude that the clinical, arthroscopic and histological outcomes are comparable for both ACI-C and MACI. While MACI is technically attractive, further long-term studies are required before the technique is widely adopted.},

It brings a welcome breath of fresh air to a set of questions that has vexed research efforts and educational programs that attempt to promote critical thinking. In calling for clarification on this matter, Ennis has also raised the level of discussion about the meaning of the terms subjects, domains, and even psychological transfer. No longer can we simply gloss over questions about the precise scope and limits of the putative skills that various critical thinking programs are alleged to promote. The recent paper in this journal by Perkins and Salomon (1989) also provides a useful historical overview of just how vexing this problem has been over the past 30 years. This article both replies to Ennis and continues the discussion.},

abstract = {Osteochondral defects (i.e., defects which affect both the articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone) are often associated with mechanical instability of the joint, and therefore with the risk of inducing osteoarthritic degenerative changes. Current surgical limits in the treatment of complex joint lesions could be overcome by grafting osteochondral composite tissues, engineered by combining the patient's own cells with three-dimensional (3D) porous biomaterials of pre-defined size and shape. Various strategies have been reported for the engineering of osteochondral composites, which result from the use of one or more cell types cultured into single-component or composite scaffolds in a broad spectrum of compositions and biomechanical properties. The variety of concepts and models proposed by different groups for the generation of osteochondral grafts reflects that understanding of the requirements to restore a normal joint function is still poor. In order to introduce the use of engineered osteochondral composites in the routine clinical practice, it will be necessary to comprehensively address a number of critical issues, including those related to the size and shape of the graft to be generated, the cell type(s) and properties of the scaffold(s) to be used, the potential physical conditioning to be applied, the degree of functionality required, and the strategy for a cost-effective manufacturing. The progress made in material science, cell biology, mechanobiology and bioreactor technology will be key to support advances in this challenging field.},

Levels of alpha 3 and alpha 5 were about 25-30% of that in fibroblasts. When the chondrocytes were cultured in the presence of ascorbate in suspension, the cells aggregated into clusters.

abstract = {The predominant proteoglycan present in cartilage is the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 'aggrecan'. Following its secretion, aggrecan self-assembles into a supramolecular structure with as many as 50 monomers bound to a filament of hyaluronan. Aggrecan serves a direct, primary role providing the osmotic resistance necessary for cartilage to resist compressive loads. Other proteoglycans expressed during chondrogenesis and in cartilage include the cell surface syndecans and glypican, the small leucine-rich proteoglycans decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, lumican and epiphycan and the basement membrane proteoglycan, perlecan. The emerging functions of these proteoglycans in cartilage will enhance our understanding of chondrogenesis and cartilage degeneration.},

abstract = {In numerous cell types, the cytoskeleton has been widely implicated in mechanotransduction pathways involving stretch-activated ion channels, integrins and deformation of intracellular organelles. Studies have also demonstrated that the cytoskeleton can undergo remodelling in response to mechanical stimuli such as tensile strain or fluid flow. In articular chondrocytes, the mechanotransduction pathways are complex, inter-related and as yet, poorly understood. Furthermore, little is known of how the chondrocyte cytoskeleton responds to physiological mechanical loading. This study utilises the well-characterised chondrocyte-agarose model and an established confocal image-analysis technique to demonstrate that both static and cyclic, compressive strain and hydrostatic pressure all induce remodelling of actin microfilaments. This remodelling was characterised by a change from a uniform to a more punctate distribution of cortical actin around the cell periphery. For some loading regimes, this remodelling was reversed over a subsequent 1h unloaded period. This reversible remodelling of actin cytoskeleton may therefore represent a mechanism through which the chondrocyte alters its mechanical properties and mechanosensitivity in response to physiological mechanical loading.},

abstract = {The influence of static and intermittent stress on articular cartilage metabolism was examined in vitro. Full-thickness plugs of cartilage from femoral condyles of normal adult dogs were cultured while static or cyclic stresses were applied for 2 hours. The plugs were then incubated under atmospheric pressure for 2 hours in medium containing radioactive label, to provide measurements of net synthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) or protein. As a control, cartilage from the same knee was cultured in the apparatus at atmospheric pressure. When cartilage plugs were exposed to static stress, or to cyclic stresses at a duty cycle of 60 seconds on/60 seconds off, net GAG synthesis was suppressed to 30-60% of that in controls. In contrast, when a duty cycle of 4 seconds on/11 seconds off was used, GAG synthesis was increased by 34%. The duty cycle which increased GAG synthesis did not affect protein synthesis or tissue contents of DNA, uronic acid, or water. At the cycle which suppressed GAG synthesis, protein synthesis and uronic acid content were decreased, and water content was increased. As judged by uptake of 14C-aminoisobutyric acid and 14C-xylose, the above changes in GAG synthesis do not appear to have been due to changes in diffusion of nutrient molecules through the cartilage during loading.},

abstract = {Chondrocytes in articular cartilage utilize mechanical signals in conjunction with other environmental factors to regulate their metabolic activity. However, the sequence of biomechanical and biochemical events involved in the process of mechanical signal transduction has not been fully deciphered. A fundamental step in determining the role of various factors in regulating chondrocyte activity is to characterize accurately the biophysical environment within the tissue under physiological conditions of mechanical loading. Microscopic imaging studies have revealed that chondrocytes as well as their nuclei undergo shape and volume changes in a coordinated manner with deformation of the tissue matrix. Through micromechanical experiments, it has been shown that the chondrocyte behaves as a viscoelastic solid material with a mechanical stiffness that is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the cartilage extracellular matrix. These properties seem to be due to the structure of the chondrocyte cytoskeleton, and in part, the viscoelastic properties of the cell nucleus. The mechanical properties of the pericellular matrix that immediately surrounds the chondrocyte significantly differ from those of the chondrocyte and the extracellular matrix, suggesting that the pericellular matrix plays an important role in defining the mechanical environment of the chondrocyte. These experimentally measured values for chondrocyte and cartilage mechanical properties have been used in combination with theoretical constitutive modeling of the chondrocyte within articular cartilage to predict the non-uniform and time-varying stress-strain and fluid flow environment of the cell. The ultimate goal of these studies has been to elucidate the sequence of biomechanical and biochemical events through which mechanical stress influences chondrocyte activity in both health and in disease.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that a loading-induced (bio)physical signal regulates chondrocyte behavior. In a recent study our group has demonstrated the shear stress level- and frequency-dependent effect of sinusoidal oscillatory fluid flow on bovine articular chondrocyte (BAC) cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), neglecting the fact that chondrocytes are not likely to see these ideal waveform in vivo or in vitro. Furthermore, possible overload of articular cartilage or excessive shear stress in chondrocyte cultures are more likely to be of a short nature. Therefore, in this study we choose to investigate a saw-tooth waveform oscillating fluid flow at varying exposure times in comparison to the established sinusoidal oscillatory waveform. [Ca(2+)](i), as an early signaling molecule, was quantified using the fluorescent dye fura-2. BAC were exposed to 1 Hz sinusoidal or saw-tooth waveform oscillating fluid flow at 2.2 Pa flow rates in a parallel plate flow chamber for 8 different loading times. As little as 5 cycles of oscillatory fluid flow were sufficient to increase [Ca(2+)](i) significantly over baseline. The number of responding cells could not be increased any further after a sufficient number of cycles (11), regardless of the waveform. Furthermore, a saw-tooth waveform appeared to be more stimulatory than regular sinusoidal oscillating flow at higher cycle numbers. BAC appear to be able to respond to these biophysical stimuli in a differentiated manner. This ability might give every single chondrocyte the capability to maintain its territory autonomously, since chondrocytes distributed in articular cartilage without the possibility to interact, e.g., via cell processes.},

Proteins and proteoglycans were conjugated to functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and immobilized in PEG hydrogels to create bio-synthetic scaffolds. Second passage articular chondrocytes were encapsulated into four different scaffold compositions: PEG-Proteoglycan (PP), PEG-Fibrinogen (PF), PEG-Albumin (PA), and PEG only and subjected to 15% dynamic compressive strain at 1-Hz frequency. Cellular response was evaluated in terms of cell number, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), collagen type II and collagen type I accumulation in the constructs following 24h and 28 days of stimulated and static culture. Stimulation of the constructs resulted in an increase in the cell number in all scaffolds, with no statistical difference measured among them. Dynamic stimulation of PP, PF, PA and PEG constructs resulted in a respective increase in the GAGs by 33%, 53.4%, 240.5%, and 284.5%, compared to their static controls. The permissive PEG and PA scaffolds showed a significantly larger relative increase in the GAGs in comparison to the other scaffolds tested. Collagen type II content in the PF, PA and PEG constructs increased by 78%, 1266% and 896% respectively, compared to their static controls. Permissive constructs showed a significantly larger relative increase and final absolute values of GAGs and type II collagen, compared to the PF constructs. Immunostaining for collagen type I, an indicator for chondrocyte de-differentiation, indicated that stimulation inhibited its production. Correlation maps between scaffold properties highlighted the major differences between permissive and instructive scaffolds. These results support the hypothesis that both compressive strain and scaffold bioactivity have an important effect on the chondrocyte metabolic response to mechanical stimulation, and that the 3-D environment surrounding chondrocytes can actively participate in translating mechanical stimulation to the resident cells.},

abstract = {One way in which universities have sought to articulate the outcomes of a university education is through a description of the attributes of their graduates. Recent calls for universities to demonstrate the quality of their outcomes and processes have prompted a re-examination of the generic graduate attribute outcomes many Australian universities have espoused for the past decade. As university communities struggle to identify what combination of skills, attributes and knowledge to include in these statements of graduate outcomes, and begin to come to terms with how to develop curricula to effectively achieve these outcomes, the fundamental nature of these outcomes is a vital preliminary question to address. What are these things that universities call generic graduate attributes? This is a more fundamental question than what combination of skills, attributes and knowledge should be included on the graduate 'shopping-list', it is about the nature of the things on the list, and the nature of the list itself. In seeking to further our understanding of the meaning of generic graduate attributes, the research described in this paper used phenomenographic analysis to explore academics' conceptions of generic graduate attributes in the context of contemporary teaching and learning practices at one Australian university. A way of describing the key aspects of the variation in academics' understandings of the concept of graduate attributes is presented. The contribution of discipline background to conceptions of generic attributes is considered and the implications of the observed variation for universities' current curriculum reform initiatives discussed.},

abstract = {The proteoglycans decorin and biglycan in extracts of human articular cartilage were analysed by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting, using antisera raised to peptide sequences present in the pro-regions and the mature core proteins. In adult cartilage, both pro-forms and mature processed forms of the proteoglycan core protein were observed for both decorin and biglycan. In the case of biglycan, it was also shown that additional proteolytic processing takes place after removal of the propeptide and that this accounts for the presence of non-glycanated forms of the molecule. For both decorin and biglycan, the relative abundance of the pro-forms was much less in the juvenile than the adult. Different adult connective tissues, including meniscus, tendon and intervertebral disc were also examined for the presence of pro-forms of the proteoglycans. While the mature form of decorin was present at a similar level in extracts of all tissues examined, the pro-form was only detected in the articular cartilage. In the case of biglycan, the abundance of the mature form was more varied, with high levels in articular cartilage, intermediate levels in meniscus and the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc, low levels in the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc, and non-detectable levels in the patellar tendon. The pro-form of biglycan was detected in the disc tissue extracts, albeit at a lower level than in articular cartilage, but was not detected in the meniscus or tendon. The proportion of the pro-form relative to the mature form of biglycan was, however, higher in the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc than in articular cartilage. Thus, the persistence of pro-forms of both decorin and biglycan is a feature of the extracellular matrix of some connective tissues, although their abundance is both tissue- and age-dependent, with adult articular cartilage being a particularly rich source.},

abstract = {The biochemical measure of success in assisted cartilage repair is normally judged by repair tissue cell density, mRNA and protein expression, and accumulation of extracellular matrix molecules. Existing methods to solubilize cartilage matrix proteoglycans and cellular DNA for quantification, such as papain digestion, often destroy one or more species of the above-named parameters, in order to render others measurable. We have therefore developed a methodology to measure specific levels of mRNA, protein, DNA, glycosaminoglycan, and collagen content on single pulverized 10-mg samples of cartilage, or tissue-engineered cartilage, using successive extractions in concentrated guanidine hydrochloride (GuCl) and guanidine thiocyanate (GITC) solutions. Conditions were developed to solubilize most cellular proteins, DNA, proteoglycans, and some matrix proteins with an initial GuCl extraction step. A subsequent extraction with GITC was essential to solubilize the majority of the cellular RNA. Guanidine-insoluble material was rendered soluble by papain digestion, to enable quantification of collagen, residual glycosaminoglycan, and residual unextracted DNA in individual samples. In general, total collagen, GAG, and DNA content measured in multivalent-extracted samples was similar to that obtained with samples digested directly with papain. Moreover, we were able to reliably detect, in these same multivalent extracts, expressed mRNA as well as specific cellular and extracellular matrix proteins. This multivalent assay could be applied to a variety of cells cultured in biopolymers and to tissues from which biochemical components may be otherwise difficult to extract.},

METHODS:Sixty patients (age 22.4 {\textpm} 7.4 years, sixty-two knees) with osteochondritis dissecans of a femoral condyle (forty-five medial and seventeen lateral) were treated with osteochondral autologous transplantation, autologous chondrocyte implantation with bone graft, biomimetic nanostructured osteochondral scaffold (MaioRegen) implantation, bone-cartilage paste graft, or a "one-step" bone-marrow-derived cell transplantation technique. Preoperative and follow-up evaluation included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) score, radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging.

RESULTS:The global mean IKDC score improved from 40.1 {\textpm} 14.3 preoperatively to 77.2 {\textpm} 21.3 (p {\&}lt; 0.0005) at 5.3 {\textpm} 4.7 years of follow-up, and the EQ-VAS improved from 51.7 {\textpm} 17.0 to 83.5 {\textpm} 18.3 (p {\&}lt; 0.0005). No influence of age, lesion size, duration of follow-up, or previous surgical procedures on the result was found. The only difference among the results of the surgical procedures was a trend toward better results following autologous chondrocyte implantation (p = 0.06).

CONCLUSIONS:All of the techniques were effective in achieving good clinical and radiographic results in patients with osteochondritis dissecans, and the effectiveness of autologous chondrocyte implantation was confirmed at a mean follow-up of five years. Newer techniques such as MaioRegen implantation and the "one-step" transplantation technique are based on different rationales; the first relies on the characteristics of the scaffold and the second on the regenerative potential of mesenchymal cells. Both of these newer procedures have the advantage of being minimally invasive and requiring a single operation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Although tissue engineering of articular cartilage is a promising approach for cartilage repair, it has been difficult to develop cartilaginous tissue in vitro that mimics the properties of native cartilage. Isolated chondrocytes grown in culture typically do not accumulate enough extracellular matrix, and the generated tissue possesses only a fraction of the mechanical properties of native cartilage. One potential explanation for this might be that the cells are grown in an environment that lacks the mechanical stimuli to which the chondrocytes are exposed in vivo. In this study, we compared the long-term effects of both dynamic compressive and shearing forces on cartilaginous tissue formation in vitro.

METHODS:Bovine articular chondrocytes were grown on the surface of porous ceramic substrates and were maintained under static, free-swelling conditions for a period of four weeks. Cultures were then subjected to six minutes of mechanical stimulation every other day, in either compression or shear, for an additional four-week period.

RESULTS:Cartilaginous tissues cultured in the presence of intermittent compression or shear were significantly thicker (p < 0.05) and had accumulated more extracellular matrix (p < 0.01) compared with the unstimulated controls. However, when normalized by the wet weight of the tissue, cultures stimulated in the presence of shearing forces contained more proteoglycans and collagen compared with compression-stimulated cultures. These cultures also displayed the largest increase in mechanical properties, with a threefold increase in equilibrium stress and a fivefold increase in equilibrium modulus.

CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:The results of this study demonstrate that a brief application of mechanical forces applied periodically over a long duration can improve the quality of cartilaginous tissue formed in vitro. However, the changes in tissue composition and mechanical properties were dependent on the specific mode of the applied mechanical forces, with shear stimulation eliciting the greater effect. This finding suggests that chondrocytes may respond differently to different modes of applied forces.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:Continuous passive motion (CPM) is currently a part of patient rehabilitation regimens after a variety of orthopedic surgical procedures. While CPM can enhance the joint healing process, the direct effects of CPM on cartilage metabolism remain unknown. Recent in vivo and in vitro observations suggest that mechanical stimuli can regulate articular cartilage metabolism of proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), a putative lubricating and chondroprotective molecule found in synovial fluid and at the articular cartilage surface.

OBJECTIVES:(1) Determine the topographical variation in intrinsic cartilage PRG4 secretion. (2) Apply a CPM device to whole joints in bioreactors and assess effects of CPM on PRG4 biosynthesis.

METHODS:A bioreactor was developed to apply CPM to bovine stifle joints in vitro. Effects of 24h of CPM on PRG4 biosynthesis were determined.

RESULTS:PRG4 secretion rate varied markedly over the joint surface. Rehabilitative joint motion applied in the form of CPM regulated PRG4 biosynthesis, in a manner dependent on the duty cycle of cartilage sliding against opposing tissues. Specifically, in certain regions of the femoral condyle that were continuously or intermittently sliding against meniscus and tibial cartilage during CPM, chondrocyte PRG4 synthesis was higher with CPM than without.

CONCLUSIONS:Rehabilitative joint motion, applied in the form of CPM, stimulates chondrocyte PRG4 metabolism. The stimulation of PRG4 synthesis is one mechanism by which CPM may benefit cartilage and joint health in post-operative rehabilitation.},

abstract = {The uppermost superficial surface layer of articular cartilage, the 'lamina splendens' which provides a very low friction lubrication surface in articular joints, was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Complementary specimens were also observed under SEM at -10 degrees C without dehydration or sputter ion coating. Fresh adult pig osteochondral specimens were prepared from the patellas of pig knee joints and digested with the enzymes, hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC and alkaline protease. Friction coefficients between a pyrex glass plate and the osteochondral specimens digested by enzymes as well as natural (undigested) specimens were measured, using a thrust collar apparatus. Normal saline, hyaluronic acid (HA) and a mixture of albumin, globulin, HA (AGH) were used as lubrication media. The surface irregularities usually observed in SEM studies were not apparent under AFM. The articular cartilage surface was resistant to hyaluronidase and also to chondroitinase ABC, but a fibrous structure was exhibited in alkaline protease enzymes-digested specimens. AFM analysis revealed that the thickness of the uppermost superficial surface layer of articular cartilage was between 800 nm and 2 microm in adult pig articular cartilage. The coefficient of friction (c.f.) was significantly higher in chondroitinase ABC and alkaline protease enzymes digested specimens. Generally, in normal saline lubrication medium, c.f. was higher in comparison to HA and AGH lubrication media. The role of the uppermost, superficial surface layer of articular cartilage in the lubrication mechanism of joints is discussed.},

abstract = {Dynamic interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrins influence most cellular functions. Normal cells, but even more, tumor cells are subjected to different forms of stress, including ischemia, radical oxygen species production, starvation, mechanical stress or genotoxic insults due to anti-cancer drugs or irradiation. In these situations, an adaptative cellular response occurs, integrating a complex network of intracellular signaling modules, which, depending on stress intensity, may result to either damage repair followed by complete restitution of cellular functions, or programmed cell death. Because of its implication in oncogenesis and anti-cancer therapy, cellular stress response has been thoroughly investigated. However, most of these studies have been performed in the context of isolated cells without taking into consideration that most cells are part of the tissue within which they interact with ECM through integrin. Few studies have described the influence of stress on cell-to-ECM interaction. However, one can speculate that, in these conditions, cells could functionally interact with protein microenvironment either to create positive interactions to survive (for example by facilitating protective pathways) or negative interaction to die (for example by facilitating detachment). In this review, we summarize the knowledge relative to the influence of different stress modalities on ECM remodeling, integrin expression and/or function modifications, and possible functional consequences, independently from the cellular model as these findings came from a large variety of cells (mesenchymal, endothelial, muscular, epithelial and glandular) and fields of application (cancer, vascular biology and tissue engineering). Most studies support the general notion that non-lethal stress favors ECM stiffness, integrin activation and enhanced survival. This field opens large perspectives not only in tumor biology but also in anti-cancer therapy by targeting one or several steps of the integrin-mediated signaling pathway, including integrin ligation, or activation of integrin-linked enzymes or integrin adaptors.},

This article discusses the mechanical behavior of native cartilage and surveys different types of tensile, compressive, and shear tests with their limitations. It also comprehensively reviews recent work and achievements in developing the mathematical models representing the mechanical properties of both native and engineered cartilage. Different methods for enhancing the mechanical properties of engineered cartilage are also discussed, including scaffold design, mechanical stimulation, and chemical stimulation. This article concludes with recommendations for future research aimed at achieving engineered cartilage with mechanical properties matching those found in native cartilage.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), such as BMP-7, growth factors, and cytokines, in the accumulation of superficial zone protein (SZP) in bovine articular cartilage. Calf superficial articular cartilage discs and chondrocytes were obtained for explant and monolayer culture systems, respectively. Dose- and time-dependent actions of BMP-7 on SZP accumulation were investigated in both explant and monolayer culture systems. In addition, actions of various morphogens and growth factors [BMP-2, BMP-4, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1)], and cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha)] alone, and in combination with BMP-7, on SZP accumulation were investigated in monolayer culture systems. SZP accumulation was quantified in both the cartilage and the medium using SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. In both explant and monolayer cultures, BMP-7 increased SZP accumulation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (p < 0.05). Furthermore, SZP accumulation was significantly increased in monolayer cultures by FGF-2, IGF-1, PDGF, and TGF-beta1 (p < 0.05). Both IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha significantly reduced SZP accumulation (p < 0.05). The inhibition of SZP accumulation by TNF-alpha was partially alleviated by concurrent treatment with BMP-7. The results of this investigation provide novel insights into the role of morphogens, especially BMP-7, growth factors, and cytokines in the accumulation of SZP in articular cartilage. This information has clinical implications because stimulation of SZP may ameliorate the pathology of joint function in arthritis. Furthermore, tissue engineering approaches to articular cartilage may depend on the optimal synthesis and assembly of SZP in the superficial zone to ensure functional tissue architecture.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Mechanical loading is an important regulator of chondrocytes; however, many of the mechanisms involved in chondrocyte mechanotransduction still remain unclear. Here, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels are proposed as a model system to elucidate chondrocyte response due to cell deformation, which is controlled by gel crosslinking (rho(x)).

METHODS:Bovine articular chondrocytes (50 x 10(6)cells/mL) were encapsulated in gels with three rho(x)s and subjected to static (15% strain) or dynamic (0.3 Hz or 1 Hz, 15% amplitude strain) loading for 48 h. Cell deformation was examined by confocal microscopy. Cell response was assessed by total nitric oxide (NO) production, proteoglycan (PG) synthesis ((35)SO(4)(2-)-incorporation) and cell proliferation (CP) ([(3)H]-thymidine incorporation). Oxygen consumption was assessed using an oxygen biosensor.

RESULTS:An increase in rho(x) led to lower water contents, higher compressive moduli, and higher cell deformations. Chondrocyte response was dependent on both loading regime and rho(x). For example, under a static strain, NO was not affected, while CP and PG synthesis were inhibited in low rho(x) and stimulated in high rho(x). Dynamic loading resulted in either no effect or an inhibitory effect on NO, CP, and PG synthesis. Overall, our results showed correlations between NO and CP and/or PG synthesis under static and dynamic (0.3 Hz) loading. This finding was attributed to the hypoxic environment that resulted from the high cell-seeding density.

CONCLUSION:This study demonstrates gel rho(x) and loading condition influence NO, CP, and PG synthesis. Under a hypoxic environment and certain loading conditions, NO appears to have a positive effect on chondrocyte bioactivity.},

abstract = {Disorders of articular cartilage represent some of the most common and debilitating diseases encountered in orthopaedic practice. Understanding the normal functioning of articular cartilage is a prerequisite to understanding its pathologic processes. The mechanical properties of articular cartilage arise from the complex structure and interactions of its biochemical constituents: mostly water, electrolytes, and a solid matrix composed primarily of collagen and proteoglycan. The viscoelastic properties of cartilage, due primarily to fluid flow through the solid matrix, can explain much of the deformational responses observed under many loading conditions. Degenerative processes can often be explained by a breakdown of the normal load-bearing capacity of cartilage which arises from the mechanics of this fluid flow. Several factors which may lead to such a breakdown include direct trauma to the cartilage, obesity, immobilization, and excessive repetitive loading of the cartilage. Sports activity, without traumatic injury, does not appear to be a risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis in the normal joint; however, such activity may be harmful to an abnormal joint.},

abstract = {This study examined the hypothesis that tensile strain and fluid flow differentially influence osteoarthritic human chondrocyte metabolism. Primary high-density monolayer chondrocytes cultures were exposed to varying magnitudes of tensile strain and fluid-flow using a four-point bending system. Metabolic changes were quantified by real-time PCR measurement of aggrecan, IL-6, SOX-9, and type II collagen gene expression, and by determination of nitric oxide levels in the culture medium. A linear regression model was used to investigate the roles of strain, fluid flow, and their interaction on metabolic activity. Aggrecan, type II collagen, and SOX9 mRNA expression were negatively correlated to increases in applied strain and fluid flow. An effect of the strain on the induction of nitric oxide release and IL-6 gene expression varied by level of fluid flow (and visa versa). This interaction between strain and fluid flow was negative for nitric oxide and positive for IL-6. These results confirm that articular chondrocyte metabolism is responsive to tensile strain and fluid flow under in vitro loading conditions. Although the articular chondrocytes reacted to the mechanically applied stress, it was notable that there was a differential effect of tensile strain and fluid flow on anabolic and catabolic markers.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise species of short noncoding RNA that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modification, not only regulate the expression of protein-encoding genes, but also miRNAs, such as let-7a, miR-9, miR-34a, miR-124, miR-137, miR-148 and miR-203. Conversely, another subset of miRNAs controls the expression of important epigenetic regulators, including DNA methyltransferases, histone deacetylases and polycomb group genes. This complicated network of feedback between miRNAs and epigenetic pathways appears to form an epigenetics-miRNA regulatory circuit, and to organize the whole gene expression profile. When this regulatory circuit is disrupted, normal physiological functions are interfered with, contributing to various disease processes. The present minireview details recent discoveries involving the epigenetics-miRNA regulatory circuit, suggesting possible biological insights into gene-regulatory mechanisms that may underlie a variety of diseases.},

abstract = {We have performed cDNA sequencing and homology analyses to elucidate the complete amino acid composition for a superficial zone protein (SZP) from human and bovine cartilage which has previously been shown to be a proteoglycan specifically synthesized by chondrocytes located at the surface of bovine articular cartilage and also some synovial lining cells. The results of this study indicate that cartilage SZP is homologous with a glycoprotein first described as the precursor protein of a megakaryocyte stimulating factor (MSF). Sequence comparisons and analyses indicate that (i) the amino acid composition of SZP is highly conserved between bovine and human species, (ii) SZP contains structural motifs at the N- and C-termini which are similar to those found in vitronectin and which may impart cell-proliferative and matrix-binding properties to the molecule, and (iii) SZP contains large and small mucin-like repeat domains composed of the sequences KEPAPTTT/P (76-78 repeats) and XXTTTX (6-8 repeats), respectively, which occur within a large central region of approximately 940 amino acids. The mucin-like domains are likely to be substituted with O-linked oligosaccharides which would impart lubricating properties to SZP which in part accumulates at the articular cartilage-synovial fluid interface. Additionally, we have shown that interleukin-1 inhibits the biosynthesis of chondrocyte SZP, while TGF-beta and IGF-1 increase its biosynthesis, and that in pathological (osteoarthritic) human articular cartilage SZP mRNA can be expressed as an alternatively spliced variant lacking exons 4 and 5 which encode a potential heparin binding domain. The occurrence of different SZP alternative splice variants and the differential expression of SZP in the presence of cytokines and growth factors suggest that SZP may play an important cytoprotective role by preventing cellular adhesion to the articular cartilage surface in normal cartilage metabolism. Modifications to the structure of SZP, coupled with inhibition of SZP synthesis during inflammation, may account for the attachment and invasion of pannus observed in inflammatory joint diseases.},

abstract = {We studied the deformation of the extracellular matrices in articular cartilage using a new compression-preservation method in histology. A Hoffman clamp was used to compress the tissue, which remained throughout the paraffin procedure and was removed from the embedded tissue block just before microtoming. Then 14 cartilage-bone blocks from 2 canine humeri were compressed for various strain levels from 5% to 65%. The histological sections were studied using a polarized light microscope, which generated a pair of two-dimensional maps of the fibril orientation (angle) and fibril organization (retardance) for each section. Results were 3-fold. One there was little change in the angle and retardance profiles of the tissue for strain levels 0-15% and a significant change in these profiles for strain levels 15% and above. Two for higher compression, more fibrils became aligned parallel to the articular surface; and three at approximately 30% strain, a second "transitional zone" was formed in the deep part of the tissue. We concluded that this novel compression procedure can be used effectively to study the altered architecture of the collagen matrix in compressed cartilage.},

abstract = {The load-bearing capacity of today's tissue-engineered (TE) cartilage is insufficient. The arcade-like collagen network in native cartilage plays an important role in its load-bearing properties. Inducing the formation of such collagen architecture in engineered cartilage can, therefore, enhance mechanical properties of TE cartilage. Considering the well-defined relationship between tensile strains and collagen alignment in the literature, we assume that cues for inducing this orientation should come from mechanical loading. In this study, strain fields prescribed by loading conditions of unconfined compression, sliding indentation and a novel loading regime of compression-sliding indentation are numerically evaluated to assess the probability that these would trigger a physiological collagen architecture. Results suggest that sliding indentation is likely to stimulate the formation of an appropriate superficial zone with parallel fibres. Adding lateral compression may stimulate the formation of a deep zone with perpendicularly aligned fibres. These insights may be used to improve loading conditions for cartilage tissue engineering.},

abstract = {A novel squeeze pressure bioreactor for noncontact hydrodynamic stimulation of cartilage is described. The bioreactor is based on a small piston that moves up and down, perpendicular to a tissue construct, in a fluid-filled chamber. Fluid displaced by the piston generates a pressure wave and shear stress as it moves across the sample, simulating the dynamic environment of a mobile joint. The fluid dynamics inside the squeeze pressure bioreactor was modeled using analytical and computational methods to simulate the mechanical stimuli imposed on a construct. In particular, the pressure, velocity field, and wall shear stress generated on the surface of the construct were analyzed using the theory of hydrodynamic lubrication, which describes the flow of an incompressible fluid between two surfaces in relative motion. Both the models and in-situ pressure measurements in the bioreactor demonstrate that controlled cyclic stresses of up to 10 kPa can be applied to tissue constructs. Initial tests on three-dimensional scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes show that glycosaminoglycan production is increased with regard to controls after 24 and 48 h of cyclic noncontact stimulation in the bioreactor.},

Both the collegial process and executive authority are acknowledged as necessary to position the university to bring about substantive, integrated, university-wide internationalization in response to pervasive and rapidly changing global environmental demands. Internationalization, viewed as an organizational adaptation, requires its articulation by the leadership while simultaneously institutionalizing a strategic planning process that is representative and participative in that it recognizes and utilizes the power of the culture within which it occurs. The orientation and strength of the university culture and the functioning structure can be inhibiting or facilitating of the strategies employed to advance internationalization. Two examples are juxtaposed to illustrate the range of circumstances confronting universities in a complex and dynamic external environment and their responses with respect to internationalization. Drawing from these examples, discussion centers on the alignment of internal culture with the internationalization objectives and strategies selected by the institution in order to enhance effectiveness of outcomes. It is concluded that the framework provided helps to understand the different approaches to internationalization and may be helpful from both a managerial and research perspective.},

This inventory can aid instructors and departments in reflecting on their teaching. It has been tested with several hundred university instructors and courses from mathematics and four science disciplines. Most instructors complete the inventory in 10 min or less, and the results allow meaningful comparisons of the teaching used for the different courses and instructors within a department and across different departments. We also show how the inventory results can be used to gauge the extent of use of research-based teaching practices, and we illustrate this with the inventory results for five departments. These results show the high degree of discrimination provided by the inventory, as well as its effectiveness in tracking the increase in the use of research-based teaching practices.},

Students can identify what, when, where and how they can learn. Staff can be clear about their role in the big picture. The scope and sequence of student learning is made explicit, links with assessment are clarified and curriculum planning becomes more effective and efficient. In this way the curriculum is more transparent to all the stakeholders including the teachers, the students, the curriculum developer, the manager, the public and the researcher.

One- to two-week-old bovine chondrocytes were encapsulated into peptide hydrogel and cultured for 14 days prior to the application of an alternate day loading protocol. Dynamic compression-induced aggrecan catabolism was explored by evaluating GAG loss to the culture medium, zymography for matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), gene expression of MMPs and ADAMTS proteases, and Western blot analysis for aggrecan fragments. The application of loading over 4 days increased GAG loss to the medium three- to four-fold relative to free-swelling controls. Zymogram analysis detected increased concentrations of latent MMP-9 and MMP-3 in the culture medium relative to free-swelling culture. Real-time PCR showed expression levels of MMPs and ADAMTS proteases in loaded samples that ranged from 2.5- to 95-fold higher than free-swelling culture. Aggrecan fragment analysis did not detect small (50-80 kDa) molecular weight fragments in free-swelling culture; however, dynamic compression samples contained 60-80 kDa fragments that were detected by both anti-G1 and NITEGE probes, demonstrating ADAMTS but not MMP degradation. These data suggest that partially mature cartilage tissue engineering constructs may be susceptible to catabolic degradation.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to develop a method to quantitate the displacement and strain fields within articular cartilage during equilibrium confined compression, and to use the method to determine the variation of the equilibrium confined compression modulus with depth from the articular surface in bovine cartilage. The method made use of fluorescently labeled chondrocyte nuclei as intrinsic fiducial markers. Articular cartilage was harvested from the patellofemoral groove of adult bovines and trimmed to rectangular blocks 5 mm long, 0.76 mm wide, and 500 microns deep with the articular surface intact. Test specimens were stained with the DNA binding dye Hoechst 33258, placed in a custom confined compression chamber, and viewed with an epifluorescence microscope equipped for video image acquisition. Image processing was used to localize fluorescing chondrocyte nuclei in uncompressed and compressed (approximately 17%) specimens, allowing determination of the intra-tissue displacement profile. Strain was determined as the slope of linear regression fits of the displacement data in four sequential 125-microns-thick layers. Equilibrium strains varied 6.1-fold from the articular surface through 500 microns of cartilage depth, with the greatest compressive strain in the superficial 125-microns layer and the least compressive strain in the two deepest 125-microns layers. Thus, the four successive 125-microns layers have moduli that are 0.44 (superficial), 1.07, 2.39, and 2.67 (deep) times the apparent modulus for a 500-microns thick cartilage sample assumed to be homogeneous.},

abstract = {Although critical thinking (CT) is generally acknowledged as an important aim of higher education, no validated instrument to assess CT in Dutch is available. Moreover, most instruments are validated on a broad sample with people of diverse educational backgrounds. This possibly hampers the reliability of assessing effects of instructional interventions within educational programmes, where diversity is less. This study investigates the psychometric quality of a translation of the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT) and the Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment (HCTA) in a sample of Dutch speaking freshmen majoring in educational sciences. Results show a higher content validity and preference by students for the HCTA. The CCTT, however, takes less time to administer and score, which makes it easier to use the CCTT on a larger scale. Neither of the two tests shows a high overall reliability. The strength of the correlations between the constructed-response items and the forced-choice items of the HCTA with the CCTT calls for further research on the precise relation between CT skills and dispositions and the ability of the HCTA to assess both independently.},

Blended learning allows both teacher and learner access to radically increased possibilities for understanding how we transmit and receive information, how we interact with others in educational settings, how we build knowledge, and how we assess what we have taught or learned. Blended Learning: Research Perspectives, Volume 2 provides readers with the most current, in-depth collection of research perspectives on this vital subject, addressing institutional issues, design and adoption issues, and learning issues, as well as an informed meditation on future trends and research in the field. As governments, foundations, schools, and colleges move forward with plans and investments for vast increases in blended learning environments, a new examination of the existing research on the topic is essential reading for all those involved in this educational transformation.},

abstract = {Two of the more promising lines of inquiry in efforts to understand the hypothesized linkage between organizational culture and effectiveness have focused on the differential effectiveness of organizations depending on their dominant culture type and their culture strength. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether these two lines of inquiry operate in an independent or conditional manner in explaining the hypothesized linkage between organizational culture and the performance of a sample of four-year colleges and universities. The findings provide support for both lines of inquiry, albeit not entirely in a manner suggested by their respective proponents. For example, while culture type has a decidedly stronger independent effect on institutional performance than culture strength, the differences are clearly more pronounced on campuses with "strong" rather than "weak" cultures. The implications of these findings for research on and efforts to improve the performance of colleges and universities are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Various strategies have been tested to direct and control matrix synthesis in tissue engineered cartilage, including mechanical stimulation of the construct both before and after implantation. This study examined the effects of oscillatory compression on chondrocytes in a fibrin-based tissue engineered cartilage.

DESIGN:Chondrocyte-seeded fibrin gels were cultured under unconfined mechanical compression for 10 or 20 days (free-swelling, 10% static, or 10+/-4% at 0.1 or 1Hz). During the culture period, accumulation of nitrite, sGAG, and proteolytic enzymes in the culture media were monitored. Following culture, the mechanical stiffness and biochemical content of the gels (DNA, sGAG, and hydroxyproline content and GAG Delta-disaccharide composition) were assessed.

RESULTS:Compared to free-swelling conditions, static compression had little effect on the mechanical stiffness or biochemical content of the gels. Compared to static compression, oscillatory compression produced softer gels, inhibited sGAG and hydroxyproline accumulation in the gels, and stimulated accumulation of nitrite and sGAG in the culture media. Minimal differences were observed in DNA content and Delta-disaccharide composition across treatment conditions.

CONCLUSIONS:In this study, oscillatory compression inhibited formation of cartilage-like tissues by chondrocytes in fibrin gels. These results suggest that the effects of mechanical stimuli on tissue engineered cartilage may vary substantially between different scaffold systems.},

abstract = {Mechanical disturbance is directly implicated in the development of osteoarthritis (OA) but the precise mode for degenerative changes is still largely unknown because of the complexity of the biomechanical and biochemical milieu in the articular joint. To investigate the effects of tensile strain on articular cartilage, cyclic equibiaxial tensile strain (CTS, 0.5 Hz, 10% strain) was applied to monolayer cultures of porcine articular chondrocytes by using a Flexercell strain unit. Overproduction of proinflammatory mediators and imbalanced expression of anabolic and catabolic genes were induced. The cellular secretion of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), as well as the mRNA level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were up-regulated in response to mechanical stimuli. Additionally, CTS resulted in an initial peak of anabolic response at 3 h of stretch with respect to the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan. After 12 h of CTS, the expression for these two cartilage-specific matrix proteins fell to control levels. A distinct catabolic response developed after 24 h of stretch with an increase in matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). Interestingly, a parallel increase in transforming growth factor (TGF) beta3 was associated with the anabolic changes while an increase in expression of TGF beta1, the predominant isoform of the TGF family, appeared at 24 h. The expression at 24 h of MMP-1, an enzyme that degrades interstitial collagens as well as other cartilage matrix proteins and TGF beta1, may signify a shift towards matrix remodeling and potentially a change in matrix composition as a consequence of continuous CTS.},

abstract = {The in vivo role of the extracellular matrix and the manner in which it interfaces with soluble regulators remains largely unknown. The current study reports the extracellular Type II collagen modulation of transforming growth factor-beta 1-stimulated proliferation, proteoglycan synthesis, messenger ribonucleic acid expression for transforming growth factor-beta 1, and integrin messenger ribonucleic acid expression in articular chondrocytes from adults. This study shows that this cytokine modulation occurs through a mechanism initiated by the attachment of Type II collagen to the beta1-integrin. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 stimulated deoxyribonucleic acid and proteoglycan synthesis in a bimodal fashion. Extracellular Type II collagen increased transforming growth factor-beta 1-stimulated deoxyribonucleic acid and proteoglycan synthesis, aggrecan gene expression as much as 400%, and alpha1(II) procollagen gene expression as much as 180% in a dose-dependent fashion. Heat inactivation of the Type II collagen abrogated the observed effects on deoxyribonucleic acid and proteoglycan synthesis. In contrast to Type II collagen, heat-denatured collagen and bovine serum albumin showed none of the observed effects. The presence of Type II collagen in the alginate bead cultures was found to diminish the messenger ribonucleic acid expression for alpha2 integrin and alter the cellular distribution pattern of the beta1 integrin receptors. Blocking of the beta1-integrin with cyclic-peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequences and antibodies reduced chondrocyte attachment to Type II collagen by 93%. The physiologic effects shown by the chondrocyte as a result of blocking this attachment to Type II collagen were a significant reduction in transforming growth factor-beta 1-stimulated deoxyribonucleic acid and proteoglycan synthesis. The conclusions elucidate the role played by the extracellular matrix in cytokine-specific regulation of the articular chondrocyte. The authors have shown that extracellular Type II collagen acts through a beta1-integrin mediated mechanism to modulate the chondrocyte response to transforming growth factor-beta 1.},

The expression of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) was found to be sensitive to long term cyclic compression. Explants of calf articular cartilage as well as cylindrical alginate/chondrocyte constructs were subjected to uniaxial unconfined dynamic compression for 18 hours after which total mRNA was extracted from samples. COMP expression was assessed by means of semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot techniques. The COMP transcript was found to be significantly enriched upon compression in both experimental systems. Incubation with anti-beta1 integrin blocking antibodies abolished the mechanosensitivity of COMP expression. In addition, the presence of a fully developed pericellular matrix was shown to be a prerequisite for enhanced COMP expression with cyclic loading. Cell/matrix interactions are therefore one of the key events in mechanotransduction in chondrocytes.},

abstract = {The integrity of articular cartilage depends on the proper functioning and mechanical stimulation of chondrocytes, the cells that synthesize extracellular matrix and maintain tissue health. The biosynthetic activity of chondrocytes is influenced by genetic factors, environmental influences, extracellular matrix composition, and mechanical factors. The mechanical environment of chondrocytes is believed to be an important determinant for joint health, and chondrocyte deformation in response to mechanical loading is speculated to be an important regulator of metabolic activity. In previous studies of chondrocyte deformation, articular cartilage was described as a biphasic material consisting of a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic solid phase, and an inviscid fluid phase. However, articular cartilage is known to be anisotropic and inhomogeneous across its depth. Therefore, isotropic and homogeneous models cannot make appropriate predictions for tissue and cell stresses and strains. Here, we modelled articular cartilage as a transversely isotropic, inhomogeneous (TI) material in which the anisotropy and inhomogeneity arose naturally from the microstructure of the depth-dependent collagen fibril orientation and volumetric fraction, as well as the chondrocyte shape and volumetric fraction. The purpose of this study was to analyse the deformation behaviour of chondrocytes using the TI model of articular cartilage. In order to evaluate our model against experimental results, we simulated indentation and unconfined compression tests for nominal compressions of 15%. Chondrocyte deformations were analysed as a function of location within the tissue. The TI model predicted a non-uniform behaviour across tissue depth: in indentation testing, cell height decreased by 43% in the superficial zone and between 11 and 29% in the deep zone. In unconfined compression testing, cell height decreased by 32% in the superficial zone, 25% in the middle, and 18% in the deep zones. This predicted non-uniformity is in agreement with experimental studies. The novelty of this study is the use of a cartilage material model accounting for the intrinsic inhomogeneity and anisotropy of cartilage caused by its microstructure.},

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes--although the greatest effects are in small (n $\le$ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

abstract = {DNA methylation was the first epigenetic modification discovered. Until recently, comprehensive coverage of the composition and distribution of methylated cytosines across the genome was lacking. Technological advances, however, are providing methylation maps that can reveal the genomic distribution of DNA methylation in different cell states or phenotypes. The emerging picture includes extensive gene body methylation that is highly conserved in eukaryotes, the presence of DNA methylation in previously unappreciated sequence contexts, and the discovery of another modified DNA base, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. These new data point to the role of DNA methylation both in gene silencing and gene activation; reconciliation of these seemingly contradictory roles will be essential to fully unravel the biological function of DNA methylation in eukaryotes. Here we review how these recently exposed features of the DNA methylome are challenging previously held dogmas in the field.},

The first is pivotal for retrospective QA, which sees QA in terms of accountability, and conforming to externally imposed standards. The last two are pivotal for prospective QA, which sees QA as maintaining and enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the institution. In this paper, the reflective practitioner is taken as the model for prospective QA. Three stages are involved in institutional reflective practice: articulating an espoused theory of teaching, the quality model (QM); continually improving on current practice through quality enhancement (QE), in which staff development should play an important role; and making quality feasible (QF), by removing impediments to good teaching, which often arise through distorted priorities in institutional policy and procedures. These three stages, QM, QE, and QF, are essential ingredients in prospective QA.},

This paper discusses the structure, delivery, results, and feedback on the first offering of the second year EPDS course. Based on learning objectives developed by a faculty-wide curriculum committee, the one-term course was designed with a novel hybrid delivery process. The structure incorporates common instructional material and integrated projects across all departments during the first half of the course, and continues with discipline-oriented projects to enhance and reinforce the overall learning objectives through the latter half. Over 600 second year students from the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science were enrolled, and more than a dozen instructors and 34 teaching assistants were involved in the course delivery over both academic terms. Details of the course structure, examples of instructional material and projects, and feedback from all representative parties are discussed.      },

Nonisotopically labeled probes are stable and nontoxic, have short detection times, demonstrate excellent spatial resolution of their signals and have sensitivities comparable to radiolabeled probes. We developed a simple method of generating nonisotopically labeled cRNA probes which is based on the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and used it to synthesize a panel of probes for various murine extracellular matrix genes. Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR was used to amplify defined regions of multiple extracellular matrix protein genes from the resulting first strand cDNAs. Bacteriophage promoters which had been incorporated into the PCR products were then used to generate digoxigenin-conjugated antisense and sense cRNAs. The antisense probes were employed to detect the specific extracellular matrix protein mRNAs in the EHS tumor by in situ hybridization. This technique provides a rapid and efficient alternative to conventional transcription systems which use plasmid vectors for the synthesis of digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes.},

PRG4 has characteristic motifs including somatomedin B and hemopexin domains, a chondroitin sulfate-attachment site and mucin-like repeats. During a screen of genes implicated in ectopic ossification, we found a novel mouse gene highly homologous to human and bovine PRG4 genes. Here, we report isolation, characterization and mapping of the gene, Prg4 together with characterization of its human orthologue. Prg4 cDNA was 3,320 bp long, encoding a 1,054 amino-acid protein. Human and mouse PRG4 genes each consisting of 12 exons spanned 18 and 16 kb, respectively. Characteristic motifs were conserved across species; however, the mucin-like repeat regions were highly diverse in length between species with a tendency that larger animals had longer repeats. Expression of human and mouse PRG4 genes was similar and found not only in cartilage, but also in liver, heart, lung, and bone. Expression of the mouse gene increased with progression of ectopic ossification. Multiple tissue-specific splicing variants lacking some of the motifs were found in both human and mouse. Although a specific role in the articular joint has previously been reported, the presence of multi-functional motifs as well as unique expression and alternative splicing patterns suggest that PRG4 functions in several distinctive biological process including regulation of ossification.},

abstract = {The overall body size of vertebrates is primarily determined by longitudinal bone growth at the growth plate. With age, the growth plate undergoes programmed senescence, causing longitudinal bone growth to slow and eventually cease. Indirect evidence suggests that growth plate senescence occurs because stem-like cells in the growth plate resting zone have a finite proliferative capacity that is gradually exhausted. Similar limits on replication have been observed when many types of animal cells are placed in cell culture, an effect known as the Hayflick phenomenon. However, we found that the number of population doublings of rabbit resting zone chondrocytes in culture did not depend on the age of the animal from which the cells were harvested, suggesting that the mechanisms limiting replicative capacity of growth plate chondrocytes in vivo are distinct from those in vitro. We also observed that the level of DNA methylation in resting zone chondrocytes decreased with age in vivo. This loss of methylation appeared to occur specifically with the slow proliferation of resting zone chondrocytes in vivo and was not observed with the rapid proliferation of proliferative zone chondrocytes in vivo (i.e. the level of DNA methylation did not change from the resting zone to the hypertrophic zone), with proliferation of chondrocytes in vitro, or with growth of the liver in vivo. Thus, the overall level of DNA methylation decreases during growth plate senescence. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanism limiting replication of growth plate chondrocytes in vivo involves loss of DNA methylation and, thus, loss of DNA methylation might be a fundamental biological mechanism that limits longitudinal bone growth in mammals, thereby determining the overall adult size of the organism.},

abstract = {Injury to articular cartilage predisposes that joint to further degeneration and eventually osteoarthritis. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using chondrocytes together with different biomaterial carriers as grafts for the repair of cartilage defects. The following study was undertaken to determine the effect of a variety of these materials on chondrocyte growth and extracellular matrix synthesis. We cultured chondrocytes on several commonly used materials and compared their rates of synthesis of proteoglycan and collagen. Additionally, we evaluated them in a closed culture recirculating system on these materials and compared them with standard culture techniques. This was done to see whether such a bioreactor-type system can be used to enhance the quality of in vitro reconstructed tissues. Our results demonstrated marked variability with respect to how chondrocytes responded to culture on the various materials. Bioabsorbable polymers such as polyglycolic acid (PGA)--enhanced proteoglycan synthesis, whereas collagen matrices stimulated synthesis of collagen. The use of the closed culture system, in general, improved the rates of synthesis of collagen and proteoglycan on the different material scaffolds. Exceptions were collagen synthesis on collagen matrices: use of the closed culture system did not enhance the rate of synthesis. Rates of proteoglycan synthesis on PGA scaffold initially was higher in the closed culture system but did not sustain a difference over the entire course of the 3-week culture period. This study demonstrates the importance of carrier material for the purpose of cartilage tissue reconstruction in vitro.},

abstract = {Extracellular matrices (ECM) not only serve as structural scaffolds in organs and tissues, but also determine critical cellular functions through cell-matrix interactions. These are mediated by cell surface receptors that recognise specific structural features of ECMs and, hence, overall physical properties of the acellular environment. ECM structures are subject to hierarchic organisations, which are tightly adapted to the functions of tissues and organs. Only a few specialised tasks are reserved for isolated ECM macromolecules. Instead, molecular ECM components attain their prominent functions only after polymerising into insoluble suprastructural elements, i.e. fibrils, microfibrils, or networks that, in turn, are assembled into regional tissue structures, such as fibres or basement membranes. As an outstanding feature, most, if not all, ECM suprastructures are co-polymers of more than one molecular species that differ in their identity and relative abundance. Thus, ECM suprastructures are composite biological amalgamates. The analogy to metal alloys refers to structural and functional characteristics of ECM composites, which differ from those of each homo-polymeric aggregate. At the tissue level, biological alloys can themselves be assembled into conglomerates that again assume properties distinct from those of each individual alloy. Nevertheless, most studies in matrix biology solely focus on molecular features and mechanisms. Progress has however been made in identifying principles of interactions within suprastructural elements and their functional consequences. We are now only beginning to understand the impact of suprastructural organisation on the assembly and the functions of whole tissues and many fundamental issues in this almost pristine field await discovery.},

In this study, course tracking variables refers to number of online sessions, number of original posts created, number of follow-up posts created, number of content pages viewed and number of posts read. Academic performance defined as how well a student's final grad is. These five variables were collected from 15 undergraduate courses in the first semester of academic year 2012 at one national university in Taiwan. A total of 528 related final scores were transformed to z score and analyzed to investigate the correlation between course tracking variables and academic performance. A multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate how well course tracking variables measure predicted academic performance. Results indicated that approximately 16.4% of the variability in academic performance was accounted for by student's course tracking variables measure, and three of the five variables were statistically significant.

abstract = {Cyclic mechanical loading of articular cartilage results in a complex biomechanical environment at the scale of the chondrocytes that strongly affects cellular metabolic activity. Under dynamic loading conditions, the quantitative relationships between macroscopic loading characteristics and solid and fluid mechanical variables in the local cellular environment are not well understood. In this study, an axisymmetric multiscale model of linear biphasic cell-matrix interactions in articular cartilage was developed to investigate the cellular microenvironment in an explant subjected to cyclic confined compressive loading. The model was based on the displacement-velocity-pressure (u-v-p) mixed-penalty weighted residual formulation of linear biphasic theory that was implemented in the COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS software package. The microscale cartilage environment was represented as a three-zone biphasic region consisting of a spherical chondrocyte with encapsulating pericellular matrix (PCM) that was embedded in a cylindrical extracellular matrix (ECM) subjected to cyclic confined compressive loading boundary conditions. Biphasic material properties for the chondrocyte and the PCM were chosen based on previous in vitro micropipette aspiration studies of cells or chondrons isolated from normal or osteoarthritic cartilage. Simulations performed at four loading frequencies in the range 0.01-1.0 Hz supported the hypothesized dual role of the PCM as both a protective layer for the cell and a mechanical transducer of strain. Time varying biphasic variables at the cellular scale were strongly dependent on relative magnitudes of the loading period, and the characteristic gel diffusion times for the ECM, the PCM, and the chondrocyte. The multiscale simulations also indicated that axial strain was significantly amplified in the range 0.01-1.0 Hz, with a decrease in amplification factor and frequency insensitivity at the higher frequencies. Simulations of matrix degradation due to osteoarthritis indicated that strain amplification factors were more significantly altered when loss of matrix stiffness was exclusive to the PCM. The findings of this study demonstrate the complex dependence of dynamic mechanics in the local cellular environment of cartilage on macroscopic loading features and material properties of the ECM and the chondron.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Functional tissue engineering (FTE) of articular cartilage involves the use of physiologically relevant mechanical signals to encourage the growth of engineered constructs. The goal of this study was to determine the utility of deformational loading in enhancing the mechanical properties of chondrocyte-seeded agarose hydrogels, and to investigate the role of initial cell seeding density and nutrient supply in this process.

DESIGN:Chondrocyte-seeded agarose hydrogels were cultured in free-swelling conditions or with intermittent deformational loading (10% deformation, 1 Hz, 1 h on/ 1 h off, 3 h per day, five days per week) over a two-month culture period. Disks were seeded at lower (10 million cells/ml) and higher (60 million cells/ml) seeding densities in the context of a greater medium supply than previous studies (decreasing the number of cells/ml feed medium/day) and with an increasing concentration of fetal bovine serum (10 or 20% FBS).

RESULTS:Under these more optimal nutrient conditions, at higher seeding densities and high serum concentration (20% FBS), dynamically loaded constructs show >2-fold increases in material properties relative to free-swelling controls. After two months of culture, dynamically loaded constructs achieved a Young's modulus of approximately 185 kPa and a dynamic modulus (at 1 Hz) of approximately 1.6 MPa, with a frequency dependent response similar to that of the native tissue. These values represent approximately 3/4 and approximately 1/4 the values measured for the native tissue, respectively. While significant differences were found in mechanical properties, staining and bulk measurements of both proteoglycan and collagen content of higher seeding density constructs revealed no significant differences between free-swelling and loading groups. This finding indicates that deformational loading may act to increase material properties via differences in the structural organization, the production of small linker ECM molecules, or by modulating the size of macromolecular proteoglycan aggregates.

CONCLUSIONS:Taken together, these results point to the utility of dynamic deformational loading in the mechanical preconditioning of engineered articular cartilage constructs and the necessity for increasing feed media volume and serum supplementation with increasing cell seeding densities.},

abstract = {Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that integrins act as mechanoreceptors in articular cartilage. In this study, we examined the effect of blocking RGD-dependent integrins on both ECM gene expression and ECM protein synthesis. Chondrocytes were isolated from full-depth porcine articular cartilage and seeded in 3% agarose constructs. These constructs were loaded in compression with 15% strain at 0.33 and 1 Hz for 12h, in the presence or absence of GRGDSP, which blocks RGD-dependent integrin receptors. The levels of mRNA for aggrecan, collagen II and MMP-3 were determined by semi-quantitative PCR at several time points up to 24h post-stimulation. DNA and sGAG content were determined at several time points up to 28 days post-stimulation. At 0.33 Hz, the mRNA levels for aggrecan and MMP-3 were increased after loading, but the mRNA levels for collagen II remained unchanged. Incubation with GRGDSP counteracted these effects. Loading at 1 Hz led to increased mRNA levels for all three molecules directly after loading and these effects were counteracted by incubation with GRGDSP. The constructs that were loaded at 0.33 Hz showed a lower amount of sGAG, compared to the unstrained control. In contrast, loading at 1 Hz caused an increase in sGAG deposition over the culture period. Blocking integrins had only a counteracting effect on the long-term biosynthetic response of constructs that were compressed at 1 Hz. The results confirmed the role of RGD-dependent integrins as mechanotransducers in the regulation of both ECM gene expression and matrix biosynthesis for chondrocytes seeded in agarose under the applied loading regime. Interestingly, this role seems to be dependent on the applied loading frequency.},

abstract = {Tissue engineering for cartilage regeneration provides an alternative to surgery for degenerative osteoarthritis. Recently, a highly organized three-dimensional (3D) alginate scaffold was prepared using a microfluidic device; this scaffold is effective for chondrocyte culture in~vitro. The performance of this scaffold was further demonstrated; an alginate scaffold seeded with porcine chondrocytes was implanted in the dorsal subcutaneous site of SCID mice. The recipients were sacrificed at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after transplantation. The grafted implants retrieved from the subcutaneous site were analyzed with histologic examinations. Real-time PCR was used to identify the gene expression patterns of the chondrocytes. The hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the chondrocytes survived normally in SCID mice; cartilage-like structures were formed after 4 weeks implantation. Immunohistochemical staining revealed cells secreted type II collagen, produced glycosaminoglycans (proved by alcian blue stain), and maintained the expression of S-100. On the other hand, the cells were negative for type I and type X collagen staining. PCR showed that the mRNA expressions of aggrecan and type II collagen were up-regulated at weeks two and four, while type I and type X collagen were down-regulated during the study period. In summary, this highly organized 3D alginate scaffold provided a suitable environment and maintained functional phenotypes for chondrocytes in this animal study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To assess the role of the glycoprotein PRG4 in joint lubrication and chondroprotection by measuring friction, stiffness, surface topography, and subsurface histology of the hip joints of Prg4(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice.

METHODS:Friction and elastic modulus were measured in cartilage from the femoral heads of Prg4(-/-) and WT mice ages 2, 4, 10, and 16 weeks using atomic force microscopy, and the surface microstructure was imaged. Histologic sections of each femoral head were stained and graded.

RESULTS:Histologic analysis of the joints of Prg4(-/-) mice showed an enlarged, fragmented surface layer of variable thickness with Safranin O-positive formations sometimes present, a roughened underlying articular cartilage surface, and a progressive loss of pericellular proteoglycans. Friction was significantly higher on cartilage of Prg4(-/-) mice at age 16 weeks, but statistically significant differences in friction were not detected at younger ages. The elastic modulus of the cartilage was similar between cartilage surfaces of Prg4(-/-) and WT mice at young ages, but cartilage of WT mice showed increasing stiffness with age, with significantly higher moduli than cartilage of Prg4(-/-) mice at older ages.

CONCLUSION:Deletion of the gene Prg4 results in significant structural and biomechanical changes in the articular cartilage with age, some of which are consistent with osteoarthritic degeneration. These findings suggest that PRG4 plays a significant role in preserving normal joint structure and function.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage, a connective tissue that provides resistance to compressive forces during joint movements, has not been examined in detail by conventional Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, microspectroscopy (FTIRM), or imaging (FTIRI). The current study reports FTIRM and FTIRI analyses of normal bovine cartilage and identifies the specific molecular components of cartilage that contribute to its IR spectrum. FTIRM data acquired through the superficial, middle, and deep zones of thin sections of bovine articular cartilage showed a variation in intensities of the absorbance bands that arise from the primary nonaqueous components of cartilage, collagen, and proteoglycan (primarily aggrecan) and thus reflected the differences in quantity of these specific components. The spectra of mixtures of model compounds, which had varying proportions of type II collagen and aggrecan, were analyzed to identify spectral markers that could be used to quantitatively analyze these components in cartilage. Collagen and aggrecan were then imaged by FTIRI based on markers found in the model compounds. Polarization experiments were also performed to determine the spatial distribution of the collagen orientation in the different zones of cartilage. This study provides a framework in which complex pathological changes in this heterogeneous tissue can be assessed by IR microscopic imaging.},

abstract = {In functional tissue engineering, the application of dynamic loading has been shown to improve the mechanical properties of chondrocyte-seeded agarose hydrogels relative to unloaded free swelling controls. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of dynamic loading on the transport of nutrients in tissue-engineered constructs. To eliminate confounding effects, such as nutrient consumption in cell-laden disks, this study examines the response of solute transport due to loading using a model system of acellular agarose disks and dextran in phosphate-buffered saline (3 and 70 kDa). An examination of the passive diffusion response of dextran in agarose confirms the applicability of Fick's law of diffusion in describing the behavior of dextran. Under static loading, the application of compressive strain decreased the total interstitial volume available for the 70 kDa dextran, compared to free swelling. Dynamic loading significantly enhanced the rate of solute uptake into agarose disks, relative to static loading. Moreover, the steady-state concentration under dynamic loading was found to be significantly greater than under static loading, for larger-molecular-mass dextran (70 kDa). This experimental finding confirms recent theoretical predictions that mechanical pumping of a porous tissue may actively transport solutes into the disk against their concentration gradient. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the application of dynamic loading in the presence of growth factors of large molecular weight may result in both a mechanically and chemically stimulating environment for tissue growth.},

abstract = {Over one million patients per year undergo some type of procedure involving cartilage reconstruction. Polymer hydrogels, such as alginate, have been shown to be effective carriers for chondrocytes in subcutaneous cartilage formation. The goal of our current study was to develop a method to create complex structures (nose bridge, chin, etc.) with good dimensional tolerance to form cartilage in specific shapes. Molds of facial implants were prepared using Silastic ERTV. Suspensions of chondrocytes in 2% alginate were gelled by mixing with CaSO(4) (0.2 g/mL) and injected into the molds. Constructs of various cell concentrations (10, 25, and 50 million/mL) were implanted in the dorsal aspect of nude mice and harvested at times up to 30 weeks. Analysis of implanted constructs indicated progressive cartilage formation with time. Proteoglycan and collagen constructs increased with time to approximately 60% that of native tissue. Equilibrium modulus likewise increased with time to 15% that of normal tissue, whereas hydraulic permeability decreased to 20 times that of native tissue. Implants seeded with greater concentrations of cells increased proteoglycan content and collagen content and equilibrium and decreased permeability. Production of shaped cartilage implants by this technique presents several advantages, including good dimensional tolerance, high sample-to-sample reproducibility, and high cell viability. This system may be useful in the large-scale production of precisely shaped cartilage implants.},

This review focuses on the effects of mechanical loading on cartilage and the resulting chondrocyte-mediated biosynthesis, remodeling, degradation, and repair of this tissue. The effects of compression and tissue shear deformation are compared, and approaches to the study of mechanical regulation of gene expression are described. Of particular interest regarding dense connective tissues, recent experiments have shown that mechanotransduction is critically important in vivo in the cell-mediated feedback between physical stimuli, the molecular structure of newly synthesized matrix molecules, and the resulting macroscopic biomechanical properties of the tissue.},

abstract = {Osteoarthritis, the clinical syndrome of joint pain and dysfunction caused by joint degeneration, affects more people than any other joint disease. There are no consistently effective methods for preventing osteoarthritis or slowing its progression, and symptomatic treatments provide limited benefit for many patients. Osteoarthritis disables about 10% of people who are older than 60 years, compromises the quality of life of more than 20 million Americans, and costs the United States economy more than $60 billion per year. The incidence of osteoarthritis rises precipitously with age; as a result, the prevalence and burden of this disorder is increasing rapidly. Study of the patterns osteoarthritis incidence and prevalence shows that it occurs frequently in the hand, foot, knee, spine and hip, but rarely in the ankle, wrist, elbow, and shoulder, and the most important universal risk factors are age, excessive joint loading, and joint injury. Analysis of the impact of osteoarthritis raises questions that include: Why does the incidence increase progressively with age? Why are some joints rarely affected? How do mechanical forces cause joint degeneration? What biologic and mechanical factors slow or accelerate the rate of joint degeneration? Answering these questions could lead to effective methods of preventing osteoarthritis and slowing its progression.},

abstract = {Based on previously published experimental work, computational models were developed to simulate the effect of different dynamic compression regimens on the activity of chondrocytes seeded in agarose constructs. In particular, the balance between proliferation and matrix synthesis can be adjusted by applying different intervals of continuous or intermittent mechanical compression. A phenomenological compartment based-modeling approach was used as first model. A more mechanistic cell cycle model was used as the second model. The compartment-based modeling approach was found to be useful in representing a balance between proliferation and proteoglycan synthesis, when the effect of a certain stimulation protocol is known. In order to predict the response to different intervals of mechanical stimulation, however, a more mechanistic cell cycle-based approach is required. The cell cycle model supports an important role of the onset of loading. In addition, an inhibitory effect of further loading is required, which is more likely to be related to cell cycle progression velocity than to a decreased probability of commitment to the cell cycle. The mechanisms behind this inhibitory effect and the computational implementation, however, require further investigation.},

abstract = {Chondrocytes are subjected to a variety of biophysical forces and flows during physiological joint loading, including mechanical deformation, fluid flow, hydrostatic pressure, and streaming potentials; however, the role of these physical stimuli in regulating chondrocyte behavior is still being elucidated. To isolate the effects of these forces, we subjected intact cartilage explants to 1-24 h of continuous dynamic compression or dynamic shear loading at 0.1 Hz. We then measured the transcription levels of 25 genes known to be involved in cartilage homeostasis using real-time PCR and compared the gene expression profiles obtained from dynamic compression, dynamic shear, and our recent results on static compression amplitude and duration. Using clustering analysis, we determined that transcripts for proteins with similar function had correlated responses to loading. However, the temporal expression patterns were strongly dependent on the type of loading applied. Most matrix proteins were up-regulated by 24 h of dynamic compression or dynamic shear, but down-regulated by 24 h of 50% static compression, suggesting that cyclic matrix deformation is a key stimulator of matrix protein expression. Most matrix proteases were up-regulated by 24 h under all loading types. Transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun maximally responded within 1 h to all loading types. Pre-incubating cartilage explants with either a chelator of intracellular calcium or an inhibitor of the cyclic AMP pathway demonstrated the involvement of both pathways in transcription induced by dynamic loading.},

However, data pertaining to the cellular organization of non-degenerated superficial zone of articular cartilage is not available for most human joints. The present study analyzed the arrangement of chondrocytes of non-degenerated human joints (shoulder, elbow, knee, and ankle) by using fluorescence microscopy of the superficial zone in a top-down view. The resulting horizontal chondrocyte arrangements were tested for randomness, homogeneity or a significant grouping via point pattern analysis and were correlated with the joint type in which they occurred. The present study demonstrated that human superficial chondrocytes occurred in four distinct patterns of strings, clusters, pairs or single chondrocytes. Those patterns represented a significant grouping (p < 0.0001) with horizontal alignment. Each articular joint surface was dominated by only one of these four patterns (p < 0.001). Specific patterns correlated with specific diarthrodial joint types (p < 0.001). Further studies need to establish whether these organizational patterns are a consequence of their surrounding environment or whether they are linked to a functional purpose.},

The impact of these changes is, however, affected by leadership practices and working cultures at the departmental level.

Rejecting simplistic notions of transformational leadership and organisational cultural engineering, the article identifies activity systems at the local, departmental, level as the central loci of changes in approaches to and recurrent practices in teaching and learning. Desirable change is most likely to be achieved in collective and collaborative ways, which means that change processes are contingent and contextualised, and that outcomes are unpredictable and fuzzy.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Mechanical stimulation is a widely used method to enhance the formation and properties of tissue-engineered cartilage. While this approach can be highly successful, it may be more efficient and effective to harness the known underlying mechanotransduction pathways responsible. With this aim, the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of directly stimulating the purinergic receptor pathway through exogenous adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) in absence of externally applied forces.

METHODS:Isolated bovine articular chondrocytes were seeded in high density, 3D culture and supplemented with varying doses of ATP for up to 4 weeks. The effects on biosynthesis, extracellular matrix accumulation and mechanical properties were then evaluated. Experiments were also conducted to assess whether exogenous ATP elicited any undesirable effects, such as: inflammatory mediator release, matrix turn-over and mineralization.

RESULTS:Supplementation with ATP had a profound effect on the growth and maturation of the developed tissue. Exogenous ATP (62.5-250 microM) increased biosynthesis by 80-120%, and when stimulated for a period of 4 weeks resulted in increased matrix accumulation (80% increase in collagen and 60% increase in proteoglycans) and improved mechanical properties (6.5-fold increase in indentation modulus). While exogenous ATP did not stimulate the release of inflammatory mediators or induce mineralization, high doses of ATP (250 microM) elicited a 2-fold increase in matrix metalloproteinase-13 expression suggesting the emergence of a catabolic response.

CONCLUSIONS:Harnessing the ATP-purinergic receptor pathway is a highly effective approach to improve tissue formation and impart functional mechanical properties. However, the dose of ATP needs to be controlled as not to elicit a catabolic response.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage provides a low-friction surface for joint articulation, with boundary lubrication facilitated by proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), which is secreted by chondrocytes of the superficial zone. Chondrocytes from different zones are phenotypically distinct, and their phenotypes in vitro are influenced by the system in which they are cultured. We hypothesized that culturing cells from the superficial (S) zone in two-dimensional monolayer or three-dimensional alginate would affect their synthesis of PRG4, and that subsequently seeding them atop alginate-recovered cells from the middle/ deep (M) zone in various proportions would result in tissue-engineered constructs with varying levels of PRG4 secretion and matrix accumulation. During monolayer culture, S cells retained their PRG4-secreting phenotype, whereas in alginate culture the percentage of cells secreting PRG4 decreased with time. Constructs formed with increasing percentages of S cells decreased in thickness and matrix accumulation, depending on both the culture conditions before construct formation and the S-cell density. PRG4-secreting cells were localized to the S-cell seeded construct surface, with secretion rates of 0.1-4 pg/cell/day or 0.1-1 pg/cell/day for constructs formed with monolayer-recovered or alginate-recovered S cells, respectively. Tailoring secretion of PRG4 in cartilage constructs may be useful for enhancing low-friction properties at the articular surface, while maintaining other surfaces free of PRG4 for enhancing integration with surrounding tissues.},

High density primary cultures of bovine chondrocytes were exposed to hydrostatic pressure applied intermittently at 1 Hz or constantly for 4 hours in serum-free medium or in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. mRNAs for aggrecan, types I and II collagen, and beta-actin were analyzed by Northern blots and quantified by slot blots. Proteoglycan synthesis was quantified by 35SO4 uptake into cetylpyridinium chloride-precipitable glycosaminoglycans, and cell-associated aggrecan and type-II collagen were detected by immunohistochemical techniques. In serum-free medium, intermittent pressure increased aggrecan mRNA signal by 14% and constant pressure decreased type-II collagen mRNA signal by 16% (p < 0.05). In the presence of 1% fetal bovine serum, intermittent pressure increased aggrecan and type-II collagen mRNA signals by 31% (p < 0.01) and 36% (p < 0.001), respectively, whereas constant pressure had no effect on either mRNA. Intermittent and constant pressure stimulated glycosaminoglycan synthesis 65% (p < 0.001) and 32% (p < 0.05), respectively. Immunohistochemical detection of cell-associated aggrecan and type-II collagen was increased in response to both intermittent and constant pressure. These data support the hypothesis that physiologic hydrostatic pressure directly influences the extracellular matrix metabolism of articular chondrocytes.},

The time evolution of chondrocyte proliferation, proteoglycan synthesis and loss to the media, and total deposition of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-containing matrix within agarose gels was characterized during 10 weeks in culture. To assess whether the matrix deposited within the agarose gel was mechanically and electromechanically functional, we measured in parallel cultures the time evolution of dynamic mechanical stiffness and oscillatory streaming potential in uniaxial confined compression, and determined the intrinsic equilibrium modulus, hydraulic permeability, and electrokinetic coupling coefficient of the developing cultures. Biosynthetic rates were initially high, but by 1 month had fallen to a level similar to that found in the parent calf articular cartilage from which the cells were extracted. The majority of the newly synthesized proteoglycans remained in the gel. Histological sections showed matrix rich in proteoglycans and collagen fibrils developing around individual cells. The equilibrium modulus, dynamic stiffness, and oscillatory streaming potential rose to many times (>5x) their initial values at the start of the culture; the hydraulic permeability decreased to a fraction (approximately 1/10) that of the cell-laden porous agarose at the beginning of the culture. By day 35 of culture, DNA concentration (cell density), GAG concentration, stiffness, and streaming potential were all approximately 25% that of calf articular cartilage. The frequency dependence of the dynamic stiffness and potential was similar to that of calf articular cartilage. Together, these results suggested the formation of a mechanically functional matrix.},

abstract = {An improved micro method for measuring sulfated glycosaminoglycans (S-GAG) in chondrocyte cultures using 1,9-Dimethylmethylene Blue (DMB) has been developed. By increasing the protein concentration in the DMB assay a soluble GAG-DMB complex is prolonged. Without bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) medium, the half time for loss of absorbance was 18 min; with 1% BSA-PBS there was no loss of absorbance over this time period. The limit of detection in a 96 well microtiter plate assay was 2 micrograms/ml; for a cuvette assay it was 1 microgram/ml. Collagen, DNA and RNA did not interfere with this assay. Hyaluronate caused an increase in absorbance at 530 nm that was lost by preincubating with Streptomyces hyaluronidase. The increase in absorbance was due to a turbidity change because there was no color shift from 600 to 530 nm but rather a uniform increase in absorbance between 400 to 700 nm. To validate the assay, the S-GAG was measured in conditioned medium from primary bovine articular chondrocyte monolayer cultures. A protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, blocked proteoglycan synthesis by greater than 90%. A cytokine, Interleukin-1 alpha, caused a dose-dependent decrease in proteoglycan accumulation. Chondroitinase ABC digestion of the chondrocyte conditioned medium completely prevented reactivity with the DMB. By preincubating samples with specific enzymes, different types of S-GAG can be measured with this assay. This assay can be used to measure changes in proteoglycans synthesized by chondrocytes.},

abstract = {Accurate quantification with real-time PCR requires the use of stable endogenous controls. Recently, there has been much debate concerning the stability of commonly used reference or housekeeping genes. To address this concern, a number of statistical approaches have been designed to analyse data and assist in determining the most appropriate reference genes for experimental comparisons. In this study, three programs, BestKeeper, Norm Finder, and geNorm were used to assess four candidate reference genes: 18S rRNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), acidic ribosomal protein large (RPLP0) and beta-actin, for use in expression profiling of individuals from divergent cattle genotypes subject to parasitic challenge with the cattle tick Boophilus microplus. Results demonstrated beta-actin and GAPDH were the most suitable reference genes in blood and could be used either individually or combined as an index to normalise data. RPLP0 was identified as the least stable gene, while 18S rRNA was omitted as being too highly expressed. As the recommendations on the most suitable reference genes varied between the programs, it is recommended that more than one should be utilised, to ensure the most robust experimental tools are selected.},

Additionally, the exogenous extracellular microenvironment affected matrix production and cartilage specific gene expression of chondrocytes from different zones. CS-based hydrogels showed the strongest response in terms of gene expression and matrix accumulation for both superficial and deep zone chondrocytes, but HA and type I collagen-based hydrogels demonstrated zonal-dependent cellular responses.},

abstract = {Critical thinking is something of value for all. The educational system has been putting an emphasis on students' development of critical thinking skills. Critical thinking is a self-regulating, intellectual process of purposefully analyzing and evaluating all available information in order to formulate a well reasoned conclusion. Scientific thinking is critical thinking that involves the use of the scientific method, a method used to validate scientific knowledge, in order to study or investigate nature or the universe (Schafersman 1994). Science educators can facilitate the development of scientific thinking skills through scientific inquiry. What better way to experience scientific inquiry than through the design and implementation of experiments? "Developing the ability to design an experiment is critical to understanding of the scientific process and in promoting critical thinking skills. This skill can be developed if students are allowed to work like scientists"(Garcia, 1999). The purpose of this research is to design, implement and determine the effectiveness of our test for experimental design ability, a form of scientific thinking, in an introductory biology course, through the use of the Experimental Design Ability Test (EDAT). We chose to assess experimental design ability due to the scientific and critical thinking skills that are involved in the design process and because it is applicable to students' everyday lives. Our findings indicate that the EDAT is sensitive to improvements in experimental design ability, as students exposed to student-designed laboratories made significant gains in their experimental design abilities, whereas those who were not did not yield gains.},

This extraction method will generate samples compatible with Western blot, RNase protection, dimethyl methylene blue (DMB) assay for glycosaminoglycan, Hoechst DNA assay, and hydroxyproline assay. Most soluble matrix molecules can be extracted from pulverized samples using 4 M guanidine HCl, during a 30-min period of vortex agitation at 4 degrees C. Shorter agitation times can give inadequate solubilization. The guanidine HCl-insoluble pellet must be re-extracted with guanidine thiocyanate buffer, to solubilize RNA additionally. The final insoluble pellet can be rinsed with ethanol and digested with papain, to quantify collagen content as well as other insoluble or crosslinked material.

abstract = {Changes in intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration, also known as Ca(2+) signaling, have been widely studied in articular cartilage chondrocytes to investigate pathways of mechanotransduction. Various physical stimuli can generate an influx of Ca(2+) into the cell, which in turn is thought to trigger a range of metabolic and signaling processes. In contrast to most studies, the approach used in this study allows for continuous real time recording of calcium signals in chondrocytes in their native environment. Therefore, interactions of cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM) are fully accounted for. Calcium signaling was quantified for dynamic loading conditions and at different temperatures. Peak magnitudes of calcium signals were greater and of shorter duration at 37{\textdegree}C than at 21{\textdegree}C. Furthermore, Ca(2+) signals were involved in a greater percentage of cells in the dynamic compared to the relaxation phases of loading. In contrast to the time-delayed signaling observed in isolated chondrocytes seeded in agarose gel, Ca(2+) signaling in situ is virtually instantaneous in response to dynamic loading. These differences between in situ and in vitro cell signaling responses might provide crucial insight into the role of the ECM in providing pathways of mechanotransduction in the intact cartilage that are absent in isolated cells seeded in gel constructs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:This study examined effects of intermittent hydrostatic pressure (IHP) and a chondrogenic growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), on anabolic, catabolic, and other metabolic markers in human osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes in vitro.

METHODS:Articular chondrocytes, isolated from femoral OA cartilage and maintained in high-density monolayer culture, were examined for effects of BMP-2 and IHP on gene expression of matrix-associated proteins (aggrecan, type II collagen, and SOX9) and catabolic matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-3) and culture medium levels of the metabolic markers MMP-2, nitric oxide (NO), and glycosaminoglycan (GAG). The results were analyzed using a mixed linear regression model to investigate the effects of load and growth factor concentration.

RESULTS:IHP and BMP-2 modulated OA chondrocyte metabolism in accordance with growth factor concentration independently, without evidence of synergism or antagonism. Each type of stimulus acted independently on anabolic matrix gene expression. Type II collagen and SOX9 gene expression were stimulated by both IHP and BMP-2 whereas aggrecan was increased only by BMP-2. IHP exhibited a trend to decrease MMP-2 gene expression as a catabolic marker whereas BMP-2 did not. NO production was increased by addition of BMP-2 and IHP exhibited a trend for increased levels. GAG production was increased by BMP-2.

CONCLUSIONS:This study confirmed the hypothesis that human OA chondrocytes respond to a specific type of mechanical load, IHP, through enhanced articular cartilage macromolecule gene expression and that IHP, in combination with a chondrogenic growth factor BMP-2, additively enhanced matrix gene expression without interactive effects.},

Experts may make huge leaps up an educational ladder of inference and often forget how to explain the reasoning process through which they arrived at their complex, deep understandings. Shortcuts become invisible. In an educational setting, this phenomenon is called ldquocurse of knowledgerdquo. It describes how being an expert in something may make it more difficult to infer what a novice requires in order to develop a deep, working knowledge of engineering and scientific content. In the paper, the authors explore potential faculty development strategies to increase awareness of the ldquocurse of knowledgerdquo and offer approaches through which faculty can use their expertise for effective teaching. Several approaches are offered: (i) principles to make messages sticky, (ii) developing more reflective approaches to understanding learning and teaching, (iii) encouraging construction of teaching portfolios, and (iv) ascertaining knowledge that students have at the beginning and throughout a course.

abstract = {Objective. To determine the feasibility of using a validated set of assessment rubrics to assess students' critical-thinking and problem-solving abilities across a doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) curriculum. Methods. Trained faculty assessors used validated rubrics to assess student work samples for critical-thinking and problem-solving abilities. Assessment scores were collected and analyzed to determine student achievement of these 2 ability outcomes across the curriculum. Feasibility of the process was evaluated in terms of time and resources used. Results. One hundred sixty-one samples were assessed for critical thinking, and 159 samples were assessed for problem-solving. Rubric scoring allowed assessors to evaluate four 5- to 7-page work samples per hour. The analysis indicated that overall critical-thinking scores improved over the curriculum. Although low yield for problem-solving samples precluded meaningful data analysis, it was informative for identifying potentially needed curricular improvements. Conclusions. Use of assessment rubrics for program ability outcomes was deemed authentic and feasible. Problem-solving was identified as a curricular area that may need improving. This assessment method has great potential to inform continuous quality improvement of a PharmD program.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Exercise and passive motion exert reparative effects on inflamed joints, whereas excessive mechanical forces initiate cartilage destruction as observed in osteoarthritis. However, the intracellular mechanisms that convert mechanical signals into biochemical events responsible for cartilage destruction and repair remain paradoxical. This review summarizes how signals generated by mechanical stress may initiate repair or destruction of cartilage.

RECENT FINDINGS:Mechanical strain of low magnitude inhibits inflammation by suppressing IL-1beta and TNF-alpha-induced transcription of multiple proinflammatory mediators involved in cartilage degradation. This also results in the upregulation of proteoglycan and collagen synthesis that is drastically inhibited in inflamed joints. On the contrary, mechanical strain of high magnitude is proinflammatory and initiates cartilage destruction while inhibiting matrix synthesis. Investigations reveal that mechanical signals exploit nuclear factor-kappa B as a common pathway for transcriptional inhibition/activation of proinflammatory genes to control catabolic processes in chondrocytes. Mechanical strain of low magnitude prevents nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B, resulting in the suppression of proinflammatory gene expression, whereas mechanical strain of high magnitude induces transactivation of nuclear factor kappa B, and thus proinflammatory gene induction.

SUMMARY:The beneficial effects of physiological levels of mechanical signals or exercise may be explained by their ability to suppress the signal transduction pathways of proinflammatory/catabolic mediators, while stimulating anabolic pathways. Whether these anabolic signals are a consequence of the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B or are mediated via distinct anabolic pathways is yet to be elucidated.},

abstract = {Adult articular cartilage has depth-dependent mechanical and biochemical properties which contribute to zone-specific functions. The compressive moduli of immature cartilage and tissue-engineered cartilage are known to be lower than those of adult cartilage. The objective of this study was to determine if such tissues exhibit depth-dependent compressive properties, and how these depth-varying properties were correlated with cell and matrix composition of the tissue. The compressive moduli of fetal and newborn bovine articular cartilage increased with depth (p<0.05) by a factor of 4-5 from the top 0.1 mm (28+/-13 kPa, 141+/-10 kPa, respectively) to 1 mm deep into the tissue. Likewise, the glycosaminoglycan and collagen content increased with depth (both p<0.001), and correlated with the modulus (both p<0.01). In contrast, tissue-engineered cartilage formed by either layering or mixing cells from the superficial and middle zone of articular cartilage exhibited similarly soft regions at both construct surfaces, as exemplified by large equilibrium strains. The properties of immature cartilage may provide a template for developing tissue-engineered cartilage which aims to repair cartilage defects by recapitulating the natural development and growth processes. These results suggest that while depth-dependent properties may be important to engineer into cartilage constructs, issues other than cell heterogeneity must be addressed to generate such tissues.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To quantify the levels of proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) expression by subpopulations of chondrocytes from superficial, middle, and deep layers of normal bovine calf cartilage in various culture systems.

METHODS:Bovine calf articular cartilage discs or isolated cells were used in 1 of 3 systems of chondrocyte culture: explant, monolayer, or transplant, for 1-9 days. PRG4 expression was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of spent medium and localized by immunohistochemistry at the articular surface and within chondrocytes in explants and cultured cells.

RESULTS:Superficial chondrocytes secreted much more PRG4 than did middle and deep chondrocytes in all cultures. The pattern of PRG4 secretion into superficial culture medium varied with the duration of culture, decreasing with time in explant culture (from approximately 25 microg/cm(2)/day on days 0-1 to approximately 3 microg/cm(2)/day on days 5-9), while increasing in monolayer culture (from approximately 1 pg/cell/day on days 0-1 to approximately 7 pg/cell/day on days 7-9) and tending to increase in transplant culture (reaching approximately 2 microg/cm(2)/day by days 7-9). In all of the culture systems, inclusion of ascorbic acid stimulated PRG4 secretion, and the source of PRG4 was immunolocalized to superficial cells.

CONCLUSION:The results described here indicate that the phenotype of PRG4 secretion by chondrocytes in culture is generally maintained, in that PRG4 is expressed to a much greater degree by chondrocytes from the superficial zone than by those from the middle and deep zones. The marked up-regulation of PRG4 synthesis by ascorbic acid may have implications for cartilage homeostasis and prevention of osteoarthritic disease. Transplanting specialized cells that secrete PRG4 to a surface may impart functional lubrication and be generally applicable to many tissues in the body.},

To determine if calcium was involved in this process, the role of calcium in regulating cell shape changes, MT1-MMP expression and integrin activity in response to mechanical stimulation was examined. Stimulation-induced changes in cell shape and MT1-MMP expression were abolished by chelation of extracellular calcium, and this effect was reversed by re-introduction of calcium. Spreading was inhibited by blocking stretch-activated channels (with gadolinium), while retraction was prevented by blocking the L-Type voltage-gated channel (with nifedipine); both compounds inhibited MT1-MMP upregulation. Calcium A23187 ionophore restored cellular response further supporting a role for these channels. Calcium regulated the integrin-mediated signalling pathway, which was facilitated through Src kinase. Both calcium- and integrin-mediated pathways converged on ERK-MAPK in response to stimulation. While both integrins and calcium signalling mediate chondrocyte mechanotransduction, calcium appears to play the major regulatory role. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in chondrocyte mechanotransduction may lead to the development of improved bioengineered cartilage.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To quantify the concentration of superficial zone protein (SZP) in the articular cartilage and synovial fluid of patients with advanced osteoarthritis (OA) and to further correlate the SZP content with the friction coefficient, OA severity, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

METHODS:Samples of articular cartilage and synovial fluid were obtained from patients undergoing elective total knee replacement surgery. Additional normal samples were obtained from donated body program and tissue bank sources. Regional SZP expression in cartilage obtained from the femoral condyles was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and visualized by immunohistochemistry. Friction coefficient measurements of cartilage plugs slid in the boundary lubrication system were obtained. OA severity was graded using histochemical analyses. The concentrations of SZP and proinflammatory cytokines in synovial fluid were determined by ELISA.

RESULTS:A pattern of SZP localization in knee cartilage was identified, with load-bearing regions exhibiting high SZP expression. SZP expression patterns were correlated with friction coefficient and OA severity; however, SZP expression was observed in all samples at the articular surface, regardless of OA severity. SZP expression and aspirate volume of synovial fluid were higher in OA patients than in normal controls. Expression of cytokines was elevated in the synovial fluid of some patients.

CONCLUSION:Our findings indicate a mechanochemical coupling in which physical forces regulate OA severity and joint lubrication. The findings of this study also suggest that SZP may be ineffective in reducing joint friction in the boundary lubrication mode at an advanced stage of OA, where other mechanisms may dominate the observed tribological behavior.},

Sustainable development is an emerging area of environmental management that is important to civil engineering students. The concept can be associated with most design-related projects. In addition, the development of students' abilities to think critically about engineering problems and design projects is an important educational objective. Explicit methods for developing students' critical thinking skills have been adapted for the first-year civil engineering curriculum. The development of critical thinking skills is combined with the coverage of sustainable development concepts in this approach. This combination was chosen because the issue of sustainable development exhibits many of the characteristics of ill-structured problems that require critical thinking. Therefore, the combination of critical thinking peda...},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The zonal composition and functioning of adult articular cartilage causes depth-dependent responses to compressive injury. In immature cartilage, shear and compressive moduli as well as collagen and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content also vary with depth. However, there is little understanding of the depth-dependent damage caused by injury. Since injury to immature knee joints most often causes articular cartilage lesions, this study was undertaken to characterize the zonal dependence of biomechanical, biochemical, and matrix-associated changes caused by compressive injury.

METHODS:Disks from the superficial and deeper zones of bovine calves were biomechanically characterized. Injury to the disks was achieved by applying a final strain of 50% compression at 100%/second, followed by biomechanical recharacterization. Tissue compaction upon injury as well as sGAG density, sGAG loss, and biosynthesis were measured. Collagen fiber orientation and matrix damage were assessed using histology, diffraction-enhanced x-ray imaging, and texture analysis.

RESULTS:Injured superficial zone disks showed surface disruption, tissue compaction by 20.3 {\textpm} 4.3% (mean {\textpm} SEM), and immediate biomechanical impairment that was revealed by a mean {\textpm} SEM decrease in dynamic stiffness to 7.1 {\textpm} 3.3% of the value before injury and equilibrium moduli that were below the level of detection. Tissue areas that appeared intact on histology showed clear textural alterations. Injured deeper zone disks showed collagen crimping but remained undamaged and biomechanically intact. Superficial zone disks did not lose sGAG immediately after injury, but lost 17.8 {\textpm} 1.4% of sGAG after 48 hours; deeper zone disks lost only 2.8 {\textpm} 0.3% of sGAG content. Biomechanical impairment was associated primarily with structural damage.

CONCLUSION:The soft superficial zone of immature cartilage is vulnerable to compressive injury, causing superficial matrix disruption, extensive compaction, and textural alteration, which results in immediate loss of biomechanical function. In conjunction with delayed superficial sGAG loss, these changes may predispose the articular surface to further softening and tissue damage, thus increasing the risk of development of secondary osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {Substantial evidence has accumulated over the last 5 years that the methylation of cytosine residues in vertebrate DNA is implicated in the control of gene expression. We have used analogs of cytidine, modified in the 5 position, as specific inhibitors of DNA methylation to probe the relationship between this process and cellular differentiation. 5-Azacytidine effected marked changes in the differentiated state of cultured cells and induced the formation of biochemically differentiated muscle, fat, and chondrocytes from mouse fibroblast cell lines. Since the analog is a powerful inhibitor of DNA methylation, we suggest that this inhibition is causally related to the mechanism of phenotypic conversion. DNA extracted from cells treated with 5-azacytidine was hemimethylated and was used as an efficient acceptor of methyl groups in an in vitro reaction in the presence of eukaryotic methylases. In vitro methylation was inhibited if the substrate DNA was preincubated with a diverse range of chemical carcinogens including benzo(a)pyrene diolepoxide. Thus, chemical carcinogens may induce changes in gene expression by alteration of cellular methylation patterns. Recent experiments have also demonstrated that freshly explanted diploid fibroblasts from mice, hamsters, and humans lose substantial quantities of 5-methylcytosine during cell division and aging in culture. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine might have importance in normal differentiation and also in the aberrant gene expression found in cancer and senescence in culture.},

abstract = {Although previous studies in the field of tissue engineering have provided important information about articular cartilage, their conclusions are based on population averages and do not account for variations in cell subpopulations. To obtain a precise understanding of chondrocytes, we investigated the effects of cartilage zone and seeding duration on single chondrocyte gene expression to select an optimal zone for tissue engineering (Phase I), followed by an evaluation of growth factor exposure on the zone selected in Phase I (Phase II). In Phase I, superficial and middle/deep bovine articular chondrocytes were seeded in monolayers for 3 or 18 h. In Phase II, middle/deep chondrocytes (selected in Phase I) received 100 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) for 3 h. Real-time reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the abundance of D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the relative abundances of aggrecan, collagens I and II, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). GAPDH varied zonally, but neither time nor IGF-I had an effect on it, suggesting that GAPDH is a suitable housekeeping gene for comparisons within each zone, but not across zones. IGF-I increased the expression of aggrecan and collagen II in middle/deep chondrocytes seeded for 18 h. TIMP-1 expression increased with time in control cells, suggesting that chondrocytes enter a matrix protective state after seeding. IGF-I diminished this effect, suggesting that treatment with IGF-I refocuses chondrocytes on matrix production rather than on protection from metalloproteinases. Concomitant to increasing TIMP-1, MMP-1 was detectable by 18 h in superficial cells, providing further evidence of a trend toward matrix degradation with time. Collagen I was undetected in all cells, and no differences were observed for COMP, confirming that no dedifferentiation or osteoarthritic changes occurred. Taken together, these results establish a unique understanding of individual chondrocyte behavior.},

abstract = {Adult cartilage has a limited healing capacity. Damages resulting from disease or injury increase over time and cause severe pain. One approach to reinstate the cartilage function is tissue engineering (TE). However, the generation of TE cartilage is time consuming and expensive and its properties are so far suboptimal. As in vivo cartilage is subject to loading, it is assumed that mechanical stimulation may enhance the quality of TE cartilage. In this study the short-term influence of variable compressive strain amplitudes on mechanical and biochemical properties of scaffold-free TE cartilage was investigated. Primary porcine chondrocytes were isolated, proliferated, redifferentiated, and transferred onto hydroxyapatite carriers, resulting in scaffold-free cartilage-carrier constructs. These constructs were placed in a custom-made bioreactor. Compression amplitudes of 5%, 10%, and 20% were applied. In each experiment four constructs were loaded with dynamic compression (3000 cycles/day, 1 Hz) for 14 days and four constructs served as unloaded control. The cartilage was evaluated biochemically, histological, and mechanically. No difference in glycosaminoglycan or collagen content between the loaded and the control groups was found. However, a positive correlation between compression amplitude and normalized Young's modulus was detected (R(2)=0.59, p<0.001). The highest compression amplitude of 20% had the strongest positive effect on the mechanical properties of the TE cartilage (Young's modulus increase of 241{\textpm}28% compared to unloaded control). The data presented suggest that preconditioning with higher load amplitudes might be an attractive way of generating stiffer tissue and may help accelerating the cultivation of mechanically competent TE cartilage.},

A micro-mechanical testing device has been developed which inserts directly into the stage of a high-resolution optical microscope fitted with Nomarski interference contrast and this has permitted simultaneous morphological and mechanical observations to be conducted on articular cartilage maintained in its wet functional condition. Aligned and crimped fibrous arrays surround the deeper chondrocytes and can be observed to undergo well-defined geometric changes with applied stress. It is thought that these arrays may act as displacement or strain sensors transmitting mechanical information from the bulk matrix to their associated cells thus inducing a specific metabolic response.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Disturbances in proteoglycan metabolism of hyaline cartilage play an essential role in the pathology of degenerative joint disease. We investigated the relation between transcript expression, protein synthesis and the ultrastructural localization of the matrix-organizing proteoglycans decorin and biglycan within intra- and extracellular compartments of late-stage osteoarthritic human articular cartilage.

METHODS:Human cartilage samples of a macroscopically intact area, the adjoining area and an area of the main defect from knee joints of 10 patients with late stage osteoarthritis were investigated. In situ hybridization and immunogold histochemistry were carried out separately and in combination at the light and electron microscopic level.

RESULTS:Ultrastructurally, three main chondrocyte types were identified. The highest levels of mRNA of decorin and biglycan were produced by elongated secretory type 2 cells, already known to synthesize type I collagen. Cells with high levels of mRNA also translated the corresponding proteins to be found in the extracellular compartment. The highest production rate of decorin and biglycan was seen in the tissue area adjoining the main defect.

CONCLUSION:The results indicate that at late stages of osteoarthritis the levels of transcription and translation for decorin and biglycan are up-regulated, probably in an effort to compensate for the general proteoglycan loss, characteristic of this disease stage.},

Further understanding of zonal differences is crucial for successful development and evaluation of such grafts. We therefore aimed to characterize the secretion of the potential zonal marker clusterin by zonal articular chondrocytes in osteoarthritic and healthy articular cartilage and in tissue-engineered constructs. Clusterin secreted by superficial, middle, and deep zones equine chondrocytes was immunolocalized in cytospins of alginate cultured superficial, middle, and deep zones equine chondrocytes. Clusterin was present within the superficial zone of native cartilage; after isolation of the cells from healthy articular cartilage, staining for clusterin was limited to cells derived from the superficial zone. Staining disappeared after expansion, but reappeared during (re)differentiation and was more pronounced within the cultures derived from the superficial zones of the cartilage. The presence of clusterin was associated with clusters of differentiating chondrocytes, rather than highly proliferative cells and did not specifically colocalize with proteoglycan-4. Because staining for clusterin was more abundant in cultures of superficial chondrocytes compared to those of cells of the deeper layers, it may be used to further characterize zonal cartilage constructs.},

abstract = {Chondrocytes isolated from a variety of sources, including auricular (AU) and articular (AR) cartilage, can differ in cell behavior, growth, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production, which can impact neocartilage properties in tissue engineering approaches. This behavior is also affected by the surrounding microenvironment, including soluble factors, biomaterials, and mechanical loading. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in juvenile AU and AR chondrocyte behavior when encapsulated in radically polymerized hyaluronic acid hydrogels. When implanted in vivo, differences in macroscopic appearance, mechanical properties, glycosaminoglycan content, and collagen content were observed depending on the chondrocyte type encapsulated. Specifically, AU constructs exhibited construct growth and neocartilage formation with increases in aggregate modulus and ECM accumulation with culture, whereas AR constructs retained their construct size and remained translucent with only a minimal increase in the compressive modulus. When cultured in vitro, both cell types remained viable and differences in gene expression were observed for type I and II collagens. Likewise, differences in gene expression were noted after dynamic mechanical loading, where stimulated AR constructs exhibited 2.3- and 1.5-fold increases in type II collagen and aggrecan over free-swelling controls, while AU samples exhibited smaller fold increases of 1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively. Thus, these data indicate that the specific cell source, cell/material interactions, and loading environment are important in the final properties of tissue-engineered products.},

It is evolving from an occupation that provides employers and clients with competent technical advice to a profession that serves the community in a socially responsible manner. Traditional engineering education caters to the former ideal, whereas increasingly both engineers themselves and their professional societies aspire to the latter. Employers are also requiring more from their engineering employees than technical proficiency. A new educational approach is needed to meet these changing requirements. It is no longer sufficient, nor even practical, to attempt to cram students full of technical knowledge in the hope that it will enable them to do whatever engineering task is required of them throughout their careers. A broader, more general approach is required that not only helps students to understand basic engineering principles but also gives them the ability to acquire more specialized knowledge as the need arises.},

abstract = {In this report we describe the purification of human superficial zone protein (SZP), the generation of cross-species monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and the detection of this protein in human and animal body fluids. Human SZPs, used as immunizing antigens, were purified either from culture media of human cartilage organ cultures or from human synovial fluids. The immunizing antigens were mixed with RIBI adjuvant in one of three forms: nonmodified SZP, superficial zone protein-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate (SZP-KLH), or a mixture of superficial zone protein and hyaluronic acid (SZP-HA). A panel of MAbs including GW4.23, S6.79, S13.52, S13.233, and S17.109 were generated and characterized. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) S6.79, an IgG2b with K(D) 3.14 x 10(-9) M from SZP-KLH immunization, is of particular interest. It reacts strongly to a large molecular weight form of SZP in both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. It stains the most superficial layer of articular cartilage in immunohistochemistry, whereas the middle and deep zones of cartilage are not stained. When MAb S6.79 was applied to Western blots of human body fluids, a strong 345-kDa band was detected in samples of synovial fluid and weaker bands of similar size were detected in samples of plasma and serum. MAb S6.79 also showed cross-species immunoreactivity with SZP in samples of synovial fluids harvested from bovine, dog, guinea pig, and rabbit, as demonstrated by Western blotting and antibody absorption experiments. This cross-species MAb will be a useful tool in human and animal model studies for monitoring SZP levels and tissue distribution. It may help define the roles of SZP in normal articular joints and may be of diagnostic or prognostic value for the measurement of SZP in pathological conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Mechanical stresses are known to play important role on articular cartilage functions in vivo and also on cartilage explants and chondrocytes monolayer culture. This study examined the differential effect of cyclic and static pressures on chondrocytes cultured in alginate matrix, which is physiologically closer to the in vivo environment of cells in cartilage.

METHODS:Goat knee joint articular cartilage chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads were exposed to 1.2 and 2.4 MPa cyclic and static loadings via a custom-made cam/follower based machine. Biochemical contents (glycosaminoglycan, collagen, DNA) and protease activity of cells were analyzed separately in cellular matrix, further removed matrix and in culture medium. Morphology of chondrocytes was studied under transmission electron microscopy.

FINDINGS:Compared with controls (unloaded cells), cyclic loading increased the glycosaminoglycan content of cells at 1.2 and 2.4 MPa in cellular matrix and further removed matrix (P<0.001) whereas it decreased at similar static loads (P<0.001). In alginate matrix, chondrocytes released a metalloprotease, which required Mn(2+) for activity. Both cyclic load levels inhibited its specific activity in cellular matrix but increased it at static loading (P<0.001). The protease specific activity in further removed matrix increased at both cyclic and static loadings (P<0.001). Transmission electron microscopy data showed improved cells ultrastructure and cell-matrix interactions under cyclic load whereas these deteriorated under static loadings.

INTERPRETATION:The study suggests that cyclic load has a positive effect on chondrocytes metabolism and morphology whereas static load has a degenerative effect.},

abstract = {Our objective was to examine the potential of a genipin cross-linked human fibrin hydrogel system as a scaffold for articular cartilage tissue engineering. Human articular chondrocytes were incorporated into modified human fibrin gels and evaluated for mechanical properties, cell viability, gene expression, extracellular matrix production and subcutaneous biodegradation. Genipin, a naturally occurring compound used in the treatment of inflammation, was used as a cross-linker. Genipin cross-linking did not significantly affect cell viability, but significantly increased the dynamic compression and shear moduli of the hydrogel. The ratio of the change in collagen II versus collagen I expression increased more than 8-fold over 5 weeks as detected with real-time RT-PCR. Accumulation of collagen II and aggrecan in hydrogel extracellular matrix was observed after 5 weeks in cell culture. Overall, our results indicate that genipin appeared to inhibit the inflammatory reaction observed 3 weeks after subcutaneous implantation of the fibrin into rats. Therefore, genipin cross-linked fibrin hydrogels can be used as cell-compatible tissue engineering scaffolds for articular cartilage regeneration, for utility in autologous treatments that eliminate the risk of tissue rejection and viral infection.},

As an engineering undergraduate student at Queen{\textquoteright}s University, I have been exposed to several engineering design courses. Starting in the 2011-2012 academic year when I was in my second year, a course referred to as APSC 200/293 was introduced. I will be critically discussing my experiences both positive and negative with this design course, as well as the first year design course, and in my opinion how they can be improved. Information and feedback regarding the design courses was obtained from the faculty and compared to my observations. Starting the design courses early on in the students{\textquoteright} careers gives them an excellent introduction to the real world of engineering. However, there is great room for improvement in courses of this sort, which can be assisted by utilizing the opinions of willing students. I will further discuss these courses, their downfalls and advantages, and where improvements could be made to promote the success of students.},

abstract = {Apart from partial or total joint replacement, no surgical procedure is currently available to treat large and deep cartilage defects associated with advanced diseases such as osteoarthritis. In this work, we developed a perfusion bioreactor system to engineer human cartilage grafts in a size with clinical relevance for unicompartmental resurfacing of human knee joints (50 mm diameter {\texttimes} 3 mm thick). Computational fluid dynamics models were developed to optimize the flow profile when designing the perfusion chamber. Using the developed system, human chondrocytes could be seeded throughout large 50 mm diameter scaffolds with a uniform distribution. Following two weeks culture, tissues grown in the bioreactor were viable and homogeneously cartilaginous, with biomechanical properties approaching those of native cartilage. In contrast, tissues generated by conventional manual production procedures were highly inhomogeneous and contained large necrotic regions. The unprecedented engineering of human cartilage tissues in this large-scale opens the practical perspective of grafting functional biological substitutes for the clinical treatment for extensive cartilage defects, possibly in combination with surgical or pharmacological therapies to support durability of the implant. Ongoing efforts are aimed at integrating the up-scaled bioreactor based processes within a fully automated and closed manufacturing system for safe, standardized, and GMP compliant production of large-scale cartilage grafts.},

abstract = {The effects of short- and long-term load-controlled compression on the levels of aggrecan mRNA have been determined. Results show that a compressive stress of 0.1 MPa on bovine articular cartilage explants for 1, 4, 12, and 24 h produces a transient up-regulation of aggrecan mRNA synthesis. At 1 h, aggrecan mRNA levels in loaded explants were increased 3.2-fold compared to control explants. At longer times (>/=4 h), the levels of aggrecan mRNA returned to baseline values or stayed slightly higher. There is a dose dependence in the response of the explant to increasing levels of compressive stress (0-0.5 MPa) for 1 h. Aggrecan mRNA levels increased 2- to 3-fold at 0-0.25 MPa. At 0.5 MPa, the level of aggrecan mRNA was lower than those at 0.1 and 0.25 MPa. This dose-dependent effect suggests a reversal of the stimulatory effects of compression on aggrecan gene expression at higher loads. After 24 h of compression, the levels of aggrecan mRNA in explants subjected to any of the stress levels were not significantly different from those in control explants. The stimulatory effect of 0.1 MPa compressive stress on aggrecan mRNA levels was blocked by Rp-cAMP and U-73122, indicating the involvement of the classical signal transduction pathways in the mechanical modulation of aggrecan gene expression. The responses of link protein mRNA to compression paralleled those of aggrecan, while there was no significant change in expression of the gene for the housekeeping protein elongation factor-1 alpha. The results indicate that articular cartilage chondrocytes can respond to short-term compressive loads by transiently up-regulating expression of the aggrecan gene. The fact that long-term compression did not significantly alter aggrecan mRNA levels suggests that previously observed inhibitory effects of prolonged static compression on proteoglycan synthesis in articular cartilage may be, for the most part, mediated through mechanisms other than suppression of aggrecan mRNA levels.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:To evaluate the clinical and radiologic results, second-look arthroscopic findings, histologic evaluation, and results of immunohistochemical staining and the Western blotting test for type II collagen after microfracture for full-thickness chondral defects in patients with osteoarthritic knee.

METHODS:Between October 1997 and December 1998, 49 knees in 46 patients who had moderate osteoarthritic changes underwent microfracture; 44 patients (47 cases) had second-look arthroscopy and biopsy performed 1 year after surgery. The clinical outcomes were assessed by use of Baumgaertner's 9-point scale and joint space changes were measured radiographically; 18 knees underwent immunohistochemical study and 21 knees underwent Western blotting tests to identify formation of type II collagen.

RESULTS:Significant improvements were noted for the parameters of daily living activity and pain (P < .05). The joint spaces were widened by 1.06 mm on standing anteroposterior and by 1.37 mm on standing lateral radiographs, which showed statistical significance (P < .05). Individual defects were filled with white tissue resembling cartilage on second-look arthroscopy, and the cartilage healing was found by histologic evaluation. Type II collagen formation was identified qualitatively by immunohistochemical staining. Quantitative collagen formation by Western blotting showed 44% growth compared with the normal control. This healed tissue is a combination, or hybrid, of fibrocartilage and hyaline-like cartilage, and it is shown to contain type II collagen on immunohistochemical staining and the Western blotting test.

CONCLUSIONS:Patients with full-thickness chondral defects in the osteoarthritic knee can have improved function and see an increase in joint space after microfracture. Cartilaginous tissue containing type II collagen is formed after the microfracture procedure in the osteoarthritic knee.

To determine whether cartilage engineered in vitro contains a functional collagen network, chondrocyte-polymer constructs were cultured for up to 6 weeks and analyzed with respect to the composition and ultrastructure of collagen by using biochemical and immunochemical methods and scanning electron microscopy. Total collagen content and the concentration of pyridinium crosslinks were significantly (57% and 70%, respectively) lower in tissue-engineered cartilage that in bovine calf articular cartilage. However, the fractions of collagen types II, IX, and X and the collagen network organization, density, and fibril diameter in engineered cartilage were not significantly different from those in natural articular cartilage. The implications of these findings for the field of tissue engineering are that differentiated chondrocytes are capable of forming a complex structure of collagen matrix in vitro, producing a tissue similar to natural articular cartilage on an ultrastructural scale.},

abstract = {Within articular cartilage, the chondron microenvironment will influence chondrocyte behaviour and response to loading. Chondrons were extracted from intact cartilage using either mechanical homogenisation (MC) or enzymatic digestion (EC) and cell and matrix morphology in unstrained and compressed agarose constructs was examined. Isolated chondrocytes (IC) were used for comparison. Immunolocalisation of type VI collagen and keratan sulphate revealed differences in the structure of the pericellular microenvironment such that MC most closely resembled chondrons in situ. The unstrained cell diameters of IC and EC were larger than MC at day 1 and increased significantly over a 7 day culture period. In contrast, cell diameters for MC remained constant. Compression of constructs at day 1 resulted in cell deformation for IC and EC but not MC. The two chondron extraction methods yielded chondrons of differing matrix morphology and associated differences in cell size and cellular response to load. The results indicate that the pericellular microenvironment of MC initially possessed a greater mechanical integrity than that of EC. Although these differences may be reduced with time in culture, characterisation of mechanically isolated chondrons suggests that the stiffness of the chondrons in situ may be greater than previous estimates.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To compare matrix composition and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) fine structure among five scaffolds commonly used for in vitro chondrocyte culture and cartilage tissue engineering.

DESIGN:Bovine articular chondrocytes were seeded into agarose, alginate, collagen I, fibrin and polyglycolic acid (PGA) constructs and cultured for 20 or 40 days. In addition to construct DNA and sulfated GAG (sGAG) contents, the delta-disaccharide compositions of the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate GAGs were determined for each scaffold group via fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE).

RESULTS:Significant differences were found in cell proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation among the five scaffold groups. Significant cell proliferation was observed for all scaffold types but occurred later (20-40 days) in PGA constructs compared to the other groups (0-20 days). By 40 days, agarose constructs had the highest sGAG to DNA ratio, while alginate and collagen I had the lowest levels. Quantitative differences in the Delta-disaccharide composition of the GAGs accumulated in the different scaffolds were also found, with the most striking variations in unsulfated and disulfated delta-disaccharides. Agarose constructs had the highest fraction of disulfated residues and the lowest fraction of unsulfated residues, with a 6-sulfated/4-sulfated disaccharide ratio most similar to that of native articular cartilage.

CONCLUSIONS:The similarities and differences among scaffolds in proteoglycan accumulation and GAG composition suggest that the scaffold material directly or indirectly influences chondrocyte proteoglycan metabolism and may have an influence on the quality of tissue engineered cartilage.},

abstract = {Cartilaginous constructs have been grown in vitro using chondrocytes, biodegradable polymer scaffolds, and tissue culture bioreactors. In the present work, we studied how the composition and mechanical properties of engineered cartilage can be modulated by the conditions and duration of in vitro cultivation, using three different environments: static flasks, mixed flasks, and rotating vessels. After 4-6 weeks, static culture yielded small and fragile constructs, while turbulent flow in mixed flasks induced the formation of an outer fibrous capsule; both environments resulted in constructs with poor mechanical properties. The constructs that were cultured freely suspended in a dynamic laminar flow field in rotating vessels had the highest fractions of glycosaminoglycans and collagen (respectively 75% and 39% of levels measured in native cartilage), and the best mechanical properties (equilibrium modulus, hydraulic permeability, dynamic stiffness, and streaming potential were all about 20% of values measured in native cartilage). Chondrocytes in cartilaginous constructs remained metabolically active and phenotypically stable over prolonged cultivation in rotating bioreactors. The wet weight fraction of glycosaminoglycans and equilibrium modulus of 7 month constructs reached or exceeded the corresponding values measured from freshly explanted native cartilage. Taken together, these findings suggest that functional equivalents of native cartilage can be engineered by optimizing the hydrodynamic conditions in tissue culture bioreactors and the duration of tissue cultivation.},

abstract = {Degenerative disease and damage to articular cartilage represents a growing concern in the aging population. New strategies for engineering cartilage have employed mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a cell source. However, recent work has suggested that chondrocytes (CHs) produce extracellular matrix (ECM) with superior mechanical properties than MSCs do. Because MSC-biomaterial interactions are important for both initial cell viability and subsequent chondrogenesis, we compared the growth of MSC- and CH-based constructs in three distinct hydrogels-agarose (AG), photocrosslinkable hyaluronic acid (HA), and self-assembling peptide (Puramatrix, Pu). Bovine CHs and MSCs were isolated from the same group of donors and seeded in AG, Pu, and HA at 20 million cells/mL. Constructs were cultured for 8 weeks with biweekly analysis of construct physical properties, viability, ECM content, and mechanical properties. Correlation analysis was performed to determine quantitative relationships between formed matrix and mechanical properties for each cell type in each hydrogel. Results demonstrate that functional chondrogenesis, as evidenced by increasing mechanical properties, occurred in each MSC-seeded hydrogel. Interestingly, while CH-seeded constructs were strongly dependent on the 3D environment in which they were encapsulated, similar growth profiles were observed in each MSC-laden hydrogel. In every case, MSC-laden constructs possessed mechanical properties significantly lower than those of CH-seeded AG constructs. This finding suggests that methods for inducing MSC chondrogenesis have yet to be optimized to produce cells whose functional matrix-forming potential matches that of native CHs.},

abstract = {The functional integrity of articular cartilage is dependent on the maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a process which is controlled by chondrocytes. The regulation of ECM biosynthesis is complex and a variety of substances have been found to influence chondrocyte metabolism. In the present study we have investigated the effect of degraded collagen on the formation of type II collagen by mature bovine chondrocytes in a cell culture model. The culture medium was supplemented with collagen hydrolysate (CH) and biosynthesis of type II collagen by chondrocytes was compared to control cells treated with native type I and type II collagen and a collagen-free protein hydrolysate. The quantification of type II collagen by means of an ELISA technique was confirmed by immunocytochemical detection as well as by the incorporation of (14)C-proline in the ECM after a 48 h incubation. Chondrocytes in the control group were maintained in the basal medium for 11 days. The presence of extracellular CH led to a dose-dependent increase in type II collagen secretion. However, native collagens as well as a collagen-free hydrolysate of wheat proteins failed to stimulate the production of type II collagen in chondrocytes. These results clearly indicate a stimulatory effect of degraded collagen on the type II collagen biosynthesis of chondrocytes and suggest a possible feedback mechanism for the regulation of collagen turnover in cartilage tissue.},

abstract = {It is likely that effective application of cell-laden implants for cartilage defects depends on retention of implanted cells and interaction between implanted and host cells. The objectives of this study were to characterize stratified cartilaginous constructs seeded sequentially with superficial (S) and middle (M) chondrocyte subpopulations labeled with fluorescent cell tracking dye PKH26 (*) and determine the degree to which these stratified cartilaginous constructs maintain their architecture in vivo after implantation in mini-pigs for 1 week. Alginate-recovered cells were seeded sequentially to form stratified S*/M (only S cells labeled) and S*/M* (both S and M cells labeled) constructs. Full-thickness defects (4 mm diameter) were created in the patellofemoral groove of adult Yucatan mini-pigs and filled with portions of constructs or left empty. Constructs were characterized biochemically, histologically, and biomechanically, and stratification visualized and quantified, before and after implant. After 1 week, animals were sacrificed and implants retrieved. After 1 week in vivo, glycosaminoglycan and collagen content of constructs remained similar to that at implant, whereas DNA content increased. Histological analyses revealed features of an early repair response, with defects filled with tissues containing little matrix and abundant cells. Some implanted (PKH26-labeled) cells persisted in the defects, although constructs did not maintain a stratified organization. Of the labeled cells, 126 +/- 38% and 32 +/- 8% in S*/M and S*/M* constructs, respectively, were recovered. Distribution of labeled cells indicated interactions between implanted and host cells. Longer-term in vivo studies will be useful in determining whether implanted cells are sufficient to have a positive effect in repair.},

Chondrocytes are plated at high density (1 x 10(5) cells/cm2) in culture dishes or roller bottles with Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Before culture, chondrocytes are freed of surrounding territorial matrix. Within the first few days of culture they re-establish a territorial matrix. As time progresses, chondrocytes synthesize both territorial and extraterritorial matrices. The matrices are rich in collagen fibrils and ruthenium red-positive proteoglycans. These features are most apparent in mass roller cultures in which aggregates of cells and matrix appear as long streaks and nodules. This morphology reveals an organization of chondrocytes and their matrices that is similar to that of the parent articular cartilage in vivo.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To estimate the overall prevalence of medically-treated arthritis and other rheumatic conditions (AORC) for adults, the prevalence of specific medically-treated conditions, and the overall annual number of visits for these conditions in the ambulatory health care system.

METHODS:We used data from the 2001-2005 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and 2001-2005 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to estimate annual ambulatory health care visits for the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes thought to represent AORC. Using data on the number of prior annual visits per patient per condition, we converted the visit estimates into prevalence estimates of adults age > or =18 years with medically-treated AORC overall and for specific conditions.

RESULTS:The overall prevalence estimate of adults with medically-treated AORC was 29,150,000 adults (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 26,473,000-31,826,000) and accounted for 77,887,300 ambulatory care visits (95% CI 71,266,000-84,508,000). The top 5 most prevalent conditions were osteoarthritis and allied disorders, unspecified joint disorders, peripheral enthesopathies, unspecified arthropathies, and other disorders of synovium, tendon, or bursa.

CONCLUSION:The advantage of our approach is that it uses existing rather than expensive new surveys for tracking the prevalence of medically-treated AORC overall and tracking the prevalence of difficult to measure specific conditions. The estimates are data based and national in scope. More relevantly, they better estimate the numbers of persons whose AORC impacts on the ambulatory health care system.},

abstract = {A major challenge in cartilage tissue engineering is the need to recreate the native tissue's anisotropic extracellular matrix structure. This anisotropy has important mechanical and biological consequences and could be crucial for integrative repair. Here, we report that hydrodynamic conditions that mimic the motion-induced flow fields in between the articular surfaces in the synovial joint induce the formation of a distinct superficial layer in tissue engineered cartilage hydrogels, with enhanced production of cartilage matrix proteoglycan and Type II collagen. Moreover, the flow stimulation at the surface induces the production of the surface zone protein Proteoglycan 4 (aka PRG4 or lubricin). Analysis of second harmonic generation signature of collagen in this superficial layer reveals a highly aligned fibrillar matrix that resembles the alignment pattern in native tissue's surface zone, suggesting that mimicking synovial fluid flow at the cartilage surface in hydrodynamic bioreactors could be key to creating engineered cartilage with superficial zone features.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of unidirectional and multidirectional motion patterns on gene expression and molecule release of chondrocyte-seeded 3D scaffolds. Resorbable porous polyurethane scaffolds were seeded with bovine articular chondrocytes and exposed to dynamic compression, applied with a ceramic hip ball, alone (group 1), with superimposed rotation of the scaffold around its cylindrical axis (group 2), oscillation of the ball over the scaffold surface (group 3), or oscillation of ball and scaffold in phase difference (group 4). Compared with group 1, the proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) mRNA expression levels were markedly increased by ball oscillation (groups 3 and 4). Furthermore, the collagen type II mRNA expression was enhanced in the groups 3 and 4, while the aggrecan and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) mRNA expression levels were upregulated by multidirectional articular motion (group 4). Ball oscillation (groups 3 and 4) also increased the release of PRG4, COMP, and hyaluronan (HA) into the culture media. This indicates that the applied stimuli can contribute to the maintenance of the chondrocytic phenotype of the cells. The mechanical effects causing cell stimulation by applied surface motion might be related to fluid film buildup and/or frictional shear at the scaffold-ball interface. It is suggested that the oscillating ball drags the fluid into the joint space, thereby causing biophysical effects similar to those of fluid flow.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Expression of aggrecan is reduced during aging and osteoarthritic cartilage degeneration. CpG methylation may have a role in the down regulation of aggrecan transcriptions.

OBJECTIVE:To investigate whether a correlation between gene methylation and expression of aggrecan in chondrocytes exists.

METHODS:The human aggrecan promoter region was analysed computationally for CpG-rich regions. These were investigated for the methylation of C residues in normal (aged) and osteoarthritic chondrocytes by the bisulphite method for modifying DNA as well as sequence analysis using DNA directly extracted from normal and osteoarthritic cartilage tissue. Additionally, chondrocytic cell lines were investigated for methylation within the aggrecan promoter region.

RESULTS:The CpG-rich promoter region of the human aggrecan gene contains a 0.6 kb region that meets the criteria of a CpG island as defined by prediction programmes. A significant correlation of aggrecan mRNA expression levels and methylation status in normal (aged) and osteoarthritic chondrocytes as well as in different chondrocytic cell lines was not found.

CONCLUSIONS:Expression of aggrecan in normal cartilage and diseased states is not modulated by gross changes of CpG methylation of its promoter region. CpG methylation does not have a central role in the switch off of aggrecan promoter activity in human adult articular chondrocytes.},

abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA), the commonest form of arthritis and a major cause of morbidity, is characterized by progressive degeneration of the articular cartilage. Along with increased production and activation of degradative enzymes, altered synthesis of cartilage matrix molecules and growth factors by resident chondrocytes is believed to play a central role in this pathological process. We used an ovine meniscectomy model of OA to evaluate changes in chondrocyte expression of types I, II and III collagen; aggrecan; the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) biglycan, decorin, lumican and fibromodulin; transforming growth factor-beta; and connective tissue growth factor. Changes were evaluated separately in the medial and lateral tibial plateaux, and were confirmed for selected molecules using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Significant changes in mRNA levels were confined to the lateral compartment, where active cartilage degeneration was observed. In this region there was significant upregulation in expession of types I, II and III collagen, aggrecan, biglycan and lumican, concomitant with downregulation of decorin and connective tissue growth factor. The increases in type I and III collagen mRNA were accompanied by increased immunostaining for these proteins in cartilage. The upregulated lumican expression in degenerative cartilage was associated with increased lumican core protein deficient in keratan sulphate side-chains. Furthermore, there was evidence of significant fragmentation of SLRPs in both normal and arthritic tissue, with specific catabolites of biglycan and fibromodulin identified only in the cartilage from meniscectomized joints. This study highlights the focal nature of the degenerative changes that occur in OA cartilage and suggests that altered synthesis and proteolysis of SLRPs may play an important role in cartilage destruction in arthritis.},

In the present study, we have examined both the immunolocalisation and the mRNA expression pattern of PRG4 in tissue harvested from the compressed and tensional regions of young and mature bovine tendons. Immunohistochemical analyses, utilizing monoclonal antibody 3-A-4 which recognizes a conformational-dependent epitope on native PRG4, demonstrated that PRG4 is present predominantly at the surface of fibrocartilaginous regions of tendon, with the intensity of immunoreactivity in this region increasing with age. RT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of PRG4 mRNA can be modulated by exposure to cytokines and growth factors. In addition, analyses of human pathological tendon revealed that PRG4 may also be expressed as an alternatively spliced form lacking exons which encode part of the N-terminal matrix-binding and cell-proliferative domain; however, it remains to be determined whether such splice variants are a feature of human tendon, regardless of disease state. Taken together, these data indicate that PRG4 may play an important cytoprotective role by preventing cellular adhesion to the tendon surface as well as providing lubrication during normal tendon function, in a manner complimentary to cartilage PRG4. Structural modifications to SZP, together with a reduction in synthesis during tendon inflammation with injury and disease may account for the formation of tendon adhesions and contribute to the overall dysfunction of the tissue.},

abstract = {Lubricin, also commonly referred to as superficial zone protein (SZP) and proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), is a multifaceted, cytoprotective glycoprotein that contributes to the boundary lubrication properties facilitating low friction levels at interfacing surfaces of articular cartilage. Biological processes effecting the gain or loss of lubricin function may therefore have important consequences relevant to joint physiology and pathology. Herein, we describe experiments conducted to extend our understanding of the influence of various cytokines and growth factors on lubricin gene expression and protein secretion in synovial tissues. Exposure of synoviocytes, chondrocytes and cartilage explants to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) results in a marked reduction in the expression and/or abundance of secreted lubricin, with corresponding alterations in the amounts of cartilage-associated (boundary) lubricin. Conversely, treatment with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) significantly upregulates lubricin synthesis, secretion and cartilage boundary association. Oncostatin M also appears to be capable of modulating lubricin metabolism, with the potential to induce lubricin synthesis by chondrocytes. Collectively, the results of studies on cytokine and growth factor regulation of lubricin biosynthesis and biodistribution may help provide new insights and therapeutic perspectives for promoting joint function.},

abstract = {Epigenetics is an essential mechanism to control gene expression and fundamental cellular processes. DNA methylation in CpG-rich promoters correlates with gene silencing. Histone modification including histone acetylation and deacetylation determines the stability of the chromatin structure. Condensed chromatin (heterochromatin), which has a higher-order histone-DNA structure, prevents the access of transcriptional activators to their target genes. The fundamental unit of eukaryotic chromatin consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. Posttranslational modifications of the histone tail and the chromatin remodeling complex disrupt histone-DNA contacts and induce nucleosome mobilization. Histone acetylation of specific lysine residues in the histone tail plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation. Histone acetylation is a dynamic process regulated by the antagonistic actions of 2 families of enzymes - the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the histone deacetylases (HDACs). The balance between histone acetylation and deacetylation serves as a key epigenetic mechanism for transcription factor-dependent gene expression and the developmental process. We review emerging evidence that DNA methylation, histone acetylation modified by HAT and/or HDAC, and transcription factor-associated molecules contribute to a mechanism that can alter chromatin structure, gene expression, and cellular differentiation during chondrogenesis.},

abstract = {The use of multiple autologous osteochondral plugs (mosaicplasty) for repair of articular cartilage defects is a well-accepted technique. Since 1995, the authors have used mosaicplasty to treat more than 110 patients with cartilage defects of the knee, hip, and ankle. The first 52 consecutive patients who had mosaicplasty of the knee and have an average followup of 37 months (range, 24-56 months) were examined. Indications for surgical treatment were osteochondritis dissecans, acute trauma, and posttraumatic lesions of the femorotibial joint, femoropatellar maltracking with recurrent episodes of patella dislocations, and distinct femoropatellar arthrosis. Preoperatively, cartilage defects were classified as International Cartilage Repair Society Grade III lesions in 23 patients and Grade IV lesions in 29 patients. Two years after surgery, an increased level of knee function was found in 86% of the patients. At the latest followup, improved knee function was observed in 92% of the patients. In four patients, reoperation was necessary because of graft failure. Complications and reoperation rate were related to large surface lesions. Autologous osteochondral transplantation is a valid option for the treatment of full-thickness osteochondral defects. However, the method is limited by the defect size and the number of plugs to be taken at the donor site.},

abstract = {We have previously described a large proteoglycan named superficial zone protein that was isolated and purified from culture medium of superficial slices of bovine articular cartilage. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against superficial zone protein and used as probes in Western blot analyses for immunohistochemical studies both to determine precisely which cells within the joint synthesize the proteoglycan and to isolate a cDNA fragment from a bovine chondrocyte lambdagt11 library that encodes part of the proteoglycan. The cDNA fragment that was obtained with use of monoclonal antibody 6-A-1 encodes the 3' end of the sequence for superficial zone protein. On Western blots, monoclonal antibody 3-A-4 recognized an epitope on native, but not reduced, superficial zone protein, whereas monoclonal antibody 6-A-1 reacted with both native and denatured antigen. The proteoglycan was immunolocalized with monoclonal antibody 3-A-4 in chondrocytes predominantly within the superficial zone of fetal and adult articular cartilage and in some cells of the synovial lining. However, the proteoglycan was not detected in chondrocytes deep in articular cartilage, in nasal septal cartilage, or in synovial stromal cells. The only matrix staining positively for superficial zone protein was at the articular surface bordering the synovial cavity in adult, but not fetal, joints. Isolated chondrocytes and synovial cells showed intracellular binding of monoclonal antibody 3-A-4, and flow-cytometric analysis with the antibody gave the following percentages of immunopositive cells: 37.4, 52.5, 3.4, and 7.5 from chondrocytes from the full-thickness, superficial, and deep zones and from synovial cells, respectively. Thus, both chondrocytes and synovial cells bordering the joint cavity synthesize superficial zone protein and substantiate its usefulness as a phenotypic marker of particular cellular species lining the articular cavity.},

abstract = {This review has dealt primarily with the electromechanical and transport properties of the extracellular matrix, which generally contains ionized charged groups under physiological conditions. Connective tissues are not electrically "active" in the sense of nerve or muscle; that is, electrical signals do not propagate as waves within the tissue. However, we have attempted to show the importance of "passive" electromechanical coupling and the coupling of passive transport mechanisms to the functional health of connective tissues. The effect of mechanical and electrical stresses on cell growth and biosynthesis is a relatively new and exciting area of research that should provide important clues concerning the interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. While the role of cells in connective tissues is beyond the scope of this review, it is well known that environmental stresses have a direct effect on the structure and composition of connective tissues. Studies have shown that changes in the chemical and mechanical environment of cells can significantly alter cell synthesis of polysaccharide and protein components of the matrix. For example, Gillard et al. studied the glycosaminoglycan and collagen composition of the flexor digitorium profundus tendon of the rabbit. In regions where the tendon is subject to tensile forces, the tissue GAG content is approximately 0.2% of the dry weight, a value not unlike other tendons. However, in the small sesamoid region where the tendon hooks around the heel bone, the tendon is subjected to high compressional stresses. In this region, the GAG concentration is 15 to 20 times higher and the GAG composition is similar to that of articular cartilage. Gillard et al. found that manipulation of the tendon so as to release the compressional forces lead to a decrease in GAG content by more than 60%. Subsequent replacement of the tendon to its original position caused a concomitant increase in the GAG content. These results can be interpreted to be directly linked to the influence of mechanical forces on cell synthesis. The recent finding that cell synthesis is also affected by imposed electrical fields may suggest that electrical, mechanical and chemical signals are somehow interpreted by the cells along common pathways. The fact that electrical potentials are naturally produced near cells by deformation of the extracellular matrix provides additional support for such hypotheses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Articular cartilage is exposed to high mechanical loads under normal physiological conditions and articular chondrocytes regulate the composition of cartilaginous matrix, in response to mechanical signals. However, the intracellular pathways involved in mechanotransduction are still being defined. Using the well-characterized chondrocyte/agarose model system and dynamic compression, we report protocols for preparing and characterizing constructs of murine chondrocytes and agarose, and analyzing the effect of compression on steady-state level of mRNA by RT-PCR, gene transcription by gene reporter assay, and phosphorylation state of signalling molecules by Western-blotting. The mouse model is of particular interest because of the availability of a large choice of bio-molecular tools suitable to study it, as well as genetically modified mice.

RESULTS:Chondrocytes cultured in agarose for one week were surrounded by a newly synthesized pericellular matrix, as revealed by immunohistochemistry prior to compression experiments. This observation indicates that this model system is suitable to study the role of matrix molecules and trans-membrane receptors in cellular responsiveness to mechanical stress. The chondrocyte/agarose constructs were then submitted to dynamic compression with FX-4000C Flexercell Compression Plus System (Flexcell). After clearing proteins off agarose, Western-blotting analysis showed transient activation of Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in response to dynamic compression. After assessment by capillary electrophoresis of the quality of RNA extracted from agarose, steady-state levels of mRNA expression was measured by real time PCR. We observed an up-regulation of cFos and cJun mRNA levels as a response to compression, in accordance with the mechanosensitive character observed for these two genes in other studies using cartilage explants submitted to compression. To explore further the biological response of mouse chondrocytes to the dynamic compression at the transcriptional level, we also developed an approach for monitoring changes in gene transcription in agarose culture by using reporter promoter constructs. A decrease in promoter activity of the gene coding for type II procollagen, the most abundant protein in cartilage, was observed in response to dynamic loading.

CONCLUSION:The protocols developed here offer the possibility to perform an integrated analysis of the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction in chondrocytes, at the gene and protein level.},

abstract = {How do accreditors encourage attention to the assessment of student learning? How do faculty on the campuses respond to these actions by accreditors? What can we learn from the accredited disciplines about defining learning outcomes, promoting thoughtful campus planning for assessment, and improving student competence? Specialized accrediting bodies stand at the forefront of the assessment movement in higher education and exert important influences on program and institutional assessment and improvement. The academic programs these bodies approve are frequently among the first on a campus to consider ways to assess student competence. This book focuses on their approaches to assessment. The book opens with two foundation chapters. The first examines the concept of student competence and reviews the historical and political contexts in which assessment takes place. The second reviews best practices in carrying out assessment, including the important roles of faculty development and assessment leadership. Case studies then describe how faculty in eight professionally oriented disciplines have developed and practiced assessment on their campuses and the lessons these faculty offer to colleagues in their own and other disciplines. The book concludes with chapters on the use of authentic assessment within several disciplines on a single university campus; on the British quality assurance movement; and with a review of the lessons, issues, and challenges that are common across disciplines. The stories and examples presented in this book covering issues as diverse as faculty and student involvement, the role of outside stakeholders, and balancing external guidance and institutional autonomy-will provide immediate practical guidance for faculty and administrators active in assessment regardless of their discipline.},

abstract = {This article reviews the experimental and clinical strategies currently in use or under development for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions. The vast majority of protocols under investigation pertain to the treatment of full-thickness defects (i.e., those which penetrate the subchondral bone and trabecular-bone spaces) rather than partial-thickness ones (i.e., those which are confined to the substance of articular cartilage tissue itself). This bias probably reflects the circumstance that partial-thickness defects do not heal spontaneously whereas full-thickness ones below a critical size do, albeit transiently. And it is, of course, a seemingly easier task to manipulate a process which is readily set in train than it is to overcome an induction-problem which Nature herself has not solved. Indeed, the reasons for this inert state of partial-thickness defects have only recently been elucidated, and these are briefly discussed. However, the main body of this review deals with the various transplantation concepts implemented for the repair of full-thickness defects. These fall into two broad categories: tissue-based (entailing the grafting of perichondrial, periosteal, cartilage or bone-cartilage material) and cell-based (utilizing chondroblasts, chondrocytes, periochondrial cells or mesenchymal stem cells). Cell-based systems are further subdivided according to whether cells are transplanted within a matrix (biodegradable, non-biodegradable or synthetic) or free in suspension. Thus far, the application of cell suspensions has always been combined with the grafting of a periosteal flap. The strengths and weaknesses of each concept are discussed.},

abstract = {Successful joint resurfacing by tissue-engineered cartilage has been limited, in part, by an inability to secure the implant to bone. To overcome this, we have developed the methodology to form a cartilage implant in vitro consisting of a layer of cartilagenous tissue overlying a porous, biodegradable calcium polyphosphate (CPP) substrate. As bone will grow into the CPP after implantation, it will result in anchorage of the cartilage. In this study, the cartilagenous tissue formed in vitro after 8 weeks in culture was characterized and compared to native articular cartilage. Light microscopic examination of histological sections showed that there was a continuous layer of cartilagenous tissue on, and integrated with the subsurface of, the CPP substrate. The in vitro-formed tissue achieved a similar thickness to native articular cartilage (mean +/- SEM: in vitro = 0.94 +/- 0.03 mm; ex vivo = 1.03 +/- 0.01 mm). The cells in the in vitro-formed tissue synthesized large proteoglycans (Kav +/- SEM: in vitro = 0.27 +/- 0.01; ex vivo = 0.27 +/- 0.01) and type II collagen similar to the chondrocytes in the ex-vivo cartilage. The in vitro-formed tissue had a similar amount of proteoglycan (GAG microg/mg dry wt.: in vitro = 198 +/- 10; ex vivo = 201 +/- 13) but less collagen than the native cartilage (hydroxyproline microg/mg dry wt.: in vitro = 21 +/- 1; ex vivo = 70 +/- 8). The in vitro-formed tissue had only about 3% of the load-bearing capacity and stiffness of the native articular cartilage, determined from unconfined mechanical compression testing. Although low, this was within the range of properties reported by others for tissue-engineered cartilage. It is possible that the limited load-bearing capacity is the result of the low collagen content and further studies are required to identify the conditions that will increase collagen synthesis.},

Evidence is presented in this paper, however, which suggests that not all students may be good at critical thinking; nor do some teachers appear to teach students 'good thinking' skills. A review of the research literature in this area was undertaken and the methods and conceptions of teaching likely to inhibit and enhance critical thinking are outlined, as well as what is required to improve students' thinking skills. Ways forward in teaching critical thinking, and in helping students to learn to think well and for themselves, are described and discussed.},

abstract = {Chondrocyte mechanotransduction is poorly understood but may involve cell deformation and associated distortion of intracellular structures and organelles. This study quantifies the intracellular displacement and strain fields associated with chondrocyte deformation and in particular the distortion of the mitochondria network, which may have a role in mechanotransduction. Isolated articular chondrocytes were compressed in agarose constructs and simultaneously visualised using confocal microscopy. An optimised digital image correlation technique was developed to calculate the local intracellular displacement and strain fields using confocal images of fluorescently labelled mitochondria. The mitochondria formed a dynamic fibrous network or reticulum, which co-localised with microtubules and vimentin intermediate filaments. Cell deformation induced distortion of the mitochondria, which collapsed in the axis of compression with a resulting loss of volume. Compression generated heterogeneous intracellular strain fields indicating mechanical heterogeneity within the cytoplasm. The study provides evidence supporting the potential involvement of mitochondrial deformation in chondrocyte mechanotransduction, possibly involving strain-mediated release of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore the heterogeneous strain fields, which appear to be influenced by intracellular structure and organisation, may generate significant heterogeneity in mechanotransduction behaviour for cells subjected to identical levels of deformation.},

abstract = {As a committee of the National Academy of Engineering recognized, ethics education should foster the ability of students to analyze complex decision situations and ill-structured problems. Building on the NAE's insights, we report about an innovative teaching approach that has two main features: first, it places the emphasis on deliberation and on self-directed, problem-based learning in small groups of students; and second, it focuses on understanding ill-structured problems. The first innovation is motivated by an abundance of scholarly research that supports the value of deliberative learning practices. The second results from a critique of the traditional case-study approach in engineering ethics. A key problem with standard cases is that they are usually described in such a fashion that renders the ethical problem as being too obvious and simplistic. The practitioner, by contrast, may face problems that are ill-structured. In the collaborative learning environment described here, groups of students use interactive and web-based argument visualization software called "AGORA-net: Participate - Deliberate!". The function of the software is to structure communication and problem solving in small groups. Students are confronted with the task of identifying possible stakeholder positions and reconstructing their legitimacy by constructing justifications for these positions in the form of graphically represented argument maps. The argument maps are then presented in class so that these stakeholder positions and their respective justifications become visible and can be brought into a reasoned dialogue.

abstract = {Articular cartilage is a complex tissue maintained by chondrocytes, which undergo metabolic changes as a result of aging, disease, and injury. These changes may hinder tissue maintenance and repair, resulting in accelerated loss of articular surface and leading to end-stage arthritis. Researchers are investigating both normal and pathologic cellular and molecular processes as well as the development of chondroprotective agents to improve the metabolic function of articular cartilage. Current research is helping to clarify the mechanisms by which a variety of agents, such as glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, green tea, glucocorticoids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can modify the symptoms and course of osteoarthritis. Also under investigation are methods of stimulating repair or replacing damaged cartilage, such as matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, gene therapy, growth factors, cytokine inhibitors, and artificial cartilage substitutes. Tissue engineering, the combining of artificial matrices with cells and growth factors or genes, offers great potential for improving patient care.},

abstract = {Biglycan and decorin have been overexpressed in eukaryotic cells and two major glycoforms isolated under native conditions: a proteoglycan substituted with glycosaminoglycan chains; and a core protein form secreted devoid of glycosaminoglycans (Hocking, A. M., Strugnell, R. A., Ramamurthy, P., and McQuillan, D. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19571-19577; Ramamurthy, P., Hocking, A. M., and McQuillan, D. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19578-19584). Far-UV CD spectroscopy of decorin and biglycan proteoglycans indicates that, although they are predominantly beta-sheet, biglycan has a significantly higher content of alpha-helical structure. Decorin proteoglycan and core protein are very similar, whereas the biglycan core protein exhibits closer similarity to the decorin glycoforms than to the biglycan proteoglycan form. However, enzymatic removal of the chondroitin sulfate chains from biglycan proteoglycan does not induce a shift to the core protein structure, suggesting that the final form is influenced by polysaccharide addition only during biosynthesis. Fluorescence emission spectroscopy demonstrated that the single tryptophan residue, which is at a conserved position at the C-terminal domain of both biglycan and decorin, is found in similar microenvironments. This indicates that in this specific domain the different glycoforms do exhibit apparent conservation of structure. Exposure of decorin and biglycan to 10 M urea resulted in an increase in fluorescent intensity, which indicates that the emission from tryptophan in the native state is quenched. Comparison of urea-induced protein unfolding curves provide further evidence that decorin and biglycan assume different structures in solution. Decorin proteoglycan and core protein unfold in a manner similar to a classic two-state model, in which there is a steep transition to an unfolded state between 1 and 2 M urea. The biglycan core protein also shows a similar steep transition. However, biglycan proteoglycan shows a broad unfolding transition between 1 and 6 M urea, probably indicating the presence of stable unfolding intermediates.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The cell morphology, gene expression, and matrix synthesis of articular chondrocytes are known to vary with depth from the tissue surface. The objective of this study was to investigate if chondrocytes from different zones respond to in vitro oscillatory tensile loading in distinct ways and whether tensile strain, which is most prevalent near the articular surface, would preferentially stimulate superficial zone chondrocytes.

DESIGN:Chondrocytes were separately isolated from the superficial, middle, and deep zones of articular cartilage and seeded into three-dimensional fibrin hydrogel constructs. An intermittent protocol of oscillatory tensile loading was applied for 3 days, and the effects on extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis were assessed by measuring the incorporation of radiolabed precursors, size exclusion gel chromatography, and western blotting.

RESULTS:Tensile loading was found to be a potent stimulus for proteoglycan synthesis only in superficial zone chondrocytes. Although overall biosynthesis rates by deep zone chondrocytes were unaffected by tensile loading, the molecular characteristics of proteins and proteoglycans released to the culture medium were significantly altered so as to resemble those of superficial zone chondrocytes.

CONCLUSIONS:Oscillatory tensile loading differentially affected subpopulations of articular chondrocytes in three-dimensional fibrin hydrogel constructs. Cells isolated from deeper regions of the tissue developed some characteristics of superficial zone chondrocytes after exposure to tensile loading, which may indicate an adaptive response to the new mechanical environment. Understanding how exogenous mechanical stimuli can differentially influence chondrocytes from distinct tissue zones will yield important insights into mechanobiological processes involved in cartilage tissue development, maintenance, disease, and repair.},

abstract = {Damage to and degeneration of articular cartilage is a major health issue in industrialized nations. Articular cartilage has a particularly limited capacity for auto regeneration. At present, there is no established therapy for a sufficiently reliable and durable replacement of damaged articular cartilage. In this, as well as in other areas of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering methods are considered to be a promising therapeutic component. Nevertheless, there remain obstacles to the establishment of tissue-engineered cartilage as a part of the routine therapy for cartilage defects. One necessary aspect of potential tissue engineering-based therapies for cartilage damage that requires both elucidation and progress toward practical solutions is the reliable, cost effective cultivation of suitable tissue. Bioreactors and associated methods and equipment are the tools with which it is hoped that such a supply of tissue-engineered cartilage can be provided. The fact that in vivo adaptive physical stimulation influences chondrocyte function by affecting mechanotransduction leads to the development of specifically designed bioreactor devices that transmit forces like shear, hydrostatic pressure, compression, and combinations thereof to articular and artificial cartilage in vitro. This review summarizes the basic knowledge of chondrocyte biology and cartilage dynamics together with the exploration of the various biophysical principles of cause and effect that have been integrated into bioreactor systems for the cultivation and stimulation of chondrocytes.},

abstract = {Few research-based resources make engagement in engineering education reform and research practical for current and future educators. Yet, engineering educators are under immense pressure to address a wide variety of educational goals that extend well beyond the traditional student learning of engineering science and design. The now familiar ABET Criterion 3 a though k has placed the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of every engineering faculty member to ensure that our graduates have abilities in the areas of problem solving in complex engineering settings, teaming and communication and understandings in the areas of ethics, global and societal impact, and contemporary issues. Engineering educators must also concern themselves with recruitment and retention of a diverse student population. Creating learning experiences and environments that encourage and support the success of all students is a priority for engineering education reform. This book is primarily being written for current and future engineering educators and researchers. The focus is on the design, development, implementation, and study of a special category of open-ended problems - the model-eliciting activity. These are realistic problems with engineering content and contexts designed to tap the strengths of all students while providing hooks to address simultaneously other educational goals. As problem solving is at the heart of engineering education and practice, it is a theme of wide appeal to engineering educators. The aims of this book are to (1) provide engineering faculty with practical tools for creating, implementing, and assessing the use of open-ended problems that meet a variety of educational goals, (2) facilitate future collaborations between engineering and education, (3) forward engineering education as a scholarly discipline by providing a resource with which to inform and teach future educators and researchers. The book describes how incorporating mathematical modeling activities and projects, that are designed to reflect authentic engineering experience, into engineering classes has the potential to enhance and tap the diverse strengths of students who come from a variety of backgrounds. Based on the experience of a cadre of engineering and education professors who were at Purdue University during a major curriculum reform effort, this book provides a case study of the Purdue experience, which in part launched the historical beginning of the Department of Engineering Education, the first program in the United States. The reader will be provided with critical activities and tools designed during the project, and the book will be written in a way to help the reader adapt the work to their own situations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:(1) Provide an overview of the biomechanical factors that are required to analyze and interpret biological data from explant experiments; (2) Present a description of some of the mechano-electrochemical events which occur in cartilage explants during loading.

DESIGN:A thorough and provocative discussion on the effects of loading on articular cartilage will be presented. Five simplest loading cases are considered: hydrostatic pressure, osmotic pressure, permeation (pressure loading), confined compression and unconfined compression. Details of how such surface loadings are converted or transduced by the extracellular matrix (ECM) to pressure, fluid, solute and ion flows, deformation and electrical fields are discussed.

RESULTS:Similarities and differences in these quantities for the five types of loading are specifically noted. For example, it is noted that there is no practical mechanical loading condition that can be achieved in the laboratory to produce effects that are equal to the effects of osmotic pressure loading within the ECM. Some counter-intuitive effects from these loadings are also described. Further, the significance of flow-induced compression of the ECM is emphasized, since this frictional drag effect is likely to be one of the major effects of fluid flow through the porous-permeable ECM. Streaming potentials arising from the flow of ions past the fixed charges of the ECM are discussed in relation to the flow-induced compaction effect as well.

CONCLUSION:Understanding the differences among these explant loading cases is important; it will help to provide greater insights to the mechano-electrochemical events which mediate metabolic responses of chondrocytes in explant loading experiments.},

abstract = {The load moment of force about the knee joint during machine milking and when lifting a 12.8 kg box was quantified using a computerized static sagittal plane body model. Surface electromyography of quadriceps and hamstrings muscles was normalized and expressed as a percentage of an isometric maximum voluntary test contraction. Working with straight knees and the trunk flexed forwards induced extending knee load moments of maximum 55 Nm. Lifting the box with flexed knees gave flexing moments of 50 Nm at the beginning of the lift, irrespective of whether the burden was between or in front of the feet. During machine milking, a level difference between operator and cow of 0.70 m - 1.0 m significantly lowered the knee extending moments. To quantify the force magnitudes acting in the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral joints, a local biomechanical model of the knee was developed using a combination of cadaver knee dissections and lateral knee radiographs of healthy subjects. The moment arm of the knee extensor was significantly shorter for women than for men, which resulted in higher knee joint forces in women if the same moment was produced. A diagram for quantifying patellar forces was worked out. The force magnitudes given by the knee joint biomechanical model correlated well with experimentally forces measured by others. During the parallel squat in powerlifting, the maximum flexing knee load moment was estimated to 335-550 Nm when carrying a 382.5 kg burden and the in vivo force of a complete quadriceps tendon-muscle rupture to between 10,900 and 18,300 N. During isokinetic knee extension, the tibio-femoral compressive force reached peak magnitudes of 9 times body weight and the anteroposterior shear force was close to 1 body weight at knee angles straighter than 60 degrees, indicating that high forces stress the anterior cruciate ligament. A proximal resistance pad position decreased the shear force considerably, and this position is recommended in early rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament repairs or reconstructions. The methods presented quantify muscle activity, sagittal knee joint moments and forces, enabling assessments to be made of different work postures, training exercises and joint derangements.},

abstract = {Tissue engineering utilizes scaffolds containing chondrogenic cells to promote cartilage development at a clinically relevant scale, yet there remains a limited understanding of the optimal conditions for inducing differentiation and matrix production. We investigated how cell density and temporal exposure to chondrogenic factors impacted chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) encapsulated in poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate hydrogels. We found maximal proteoglycan and collagen production in constructs seeded between 10 and 25 {\texttimes} 10(6) cells/mL. Matrix deposition was significantly less per cell in constructs seeded at either higher or lower densities, indicating that paracrine communications may remain important despite loss of direct cell-cell contact. In vitro chondrogenesis of hMSCs was first accomplished using pellet cultures and a defined medium containing transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$1 and dexamethasone. The differentiation of hMSCs in hydrogels also required initial exposure to TGF-$\beta$1, with no chondrogenic matrix produced in its absence. If TGF-$\beta$1 was initially included for at least 7 days, its removal impacted collagen production per cell but also lead to an increase in cell number, such that total collagen deposition was equivalent to controls when TGF-$\beta$1 was included for at least 3 weeks. Further, proteoglycan content per construct was higher at 6 weeks after removal of TGF-$\beta$1 at any time. In contrast to TGF-$\beta$1, dexamethasone was not required for chondrogenesis of hMSCs in hydrogels: there was no difference in matrix deposition between hydrogels cultured with or without dexamethasone. Further, without dexamethasone, SOX9 gene expression was higher during early chondrogenesis and there was a significant reduction in collagen I deposition, suggesting that a more hyaline cartilage phenotype is achieved without dexamethasone. Collagen content at 6 weeks was lower if dexamethasone was excluded after the first 7 days, but was equivalent to control if dexamethasone was included for 2 weeks or longer. Proteoglycan deposition was unaffected by dexamethasone exclusion. These results indicate that modulating exposure to TGF-$\beta$1 is beneficial for cell survival/proliferation and matrix production from hMSCs in hydrogels, and that not only is dexamethasone dispensable but also its exclusion may be advantageous for forming hyaline cartilage.},

Model eliciting activities (MEAs) are realistic problems used in the classroom that require learners to document not only their solution to the problems, but also their processes for solving them. Studies have shown MEAs to be valuable in helping students to develop conceptual understanding, knowledge transfer , and generalizable problem-- - solving skills. This study is investigating the impact of the MEA- integrated course on students{\textquoteright} development of critical thinking skills. Ultimately, the team aims to determine whether the MEA-integrated course facilitates students{\textquoteright} critical thinking. During the fall semester of the 2012/2013 academic year three instruments will be used to evaluate the critical thinking skills (CTS) of first year engineering students. These instruments will be used as both a pre-- - and post-- - test in order to benchmark CTS of the incoming first year students, and determine the effectiveness of MEA instruction on developing student critical thinking ability. These instruments are the Cornell Critical Thinking Test Level Z (Cornell Z), the International Critical Thinking Essay Test (ICTET) and the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA). This paper will present the preliminary findings from analysis of the MEA results and pre and post tests from the study.},

abstract = {The pericellular matrix (PCM) is a narrow tissue region that surrounds chondrocytes in articular cartilage. Previous parametric studies of cell-matrix interactions suggest that the mechanical properties of the PCM relative to those of the extracellular matrix (ECM) can significantly affect the micromechanical environment of the chondrocyte. The goal of this study was to use recently quantified mechanical properties of the PCM in a biphasic finite element model of the cell-PCM-ECM structure to determine the potential influence of the PCM on the mechanical environment of the chondrocyte under normal and osteoarthritic conditions. Our findings suggest that the mismatch between the Young's moduli of PCM and ECM amplifies chondrocyte compressive strains and exhibits a significant stress shielding effect in a zone-dependent manner. Furthermore, the lower permeability of PCM relative to the ECM inhibits fluid flux near the cell by a factor of 30, and thus may have a significant effect on convective transport to and from the chondrocyte. Osteoarthritic changes in the PCM and ECM properties significantly altered the mechanical environment of the chondrocyte, leading to approximately 66% higher compressive strains and higher fluid flux near the cell. These findings provide further support for a potential biomechanical role for the chondrocyte PCM, and suggest that changes in the properties of the PCM with osteoarthritis may alter the stress-strain and fluid flow environment of the chondrocytes.},

abstract = {Lubricin is a secreted, cytoprotective glycoprotein that contributes to the essential boundary lubrication mechanisms necessary for maintaining low friction levels at articular cartilage surfaces. Diminishment of lubricin function is thereby implicated as an adverse contributing factor in degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. Lubricin occurs as a soluble component of synovial fluid, and is synthesized and localized in the superficial layer of articular cartilage (and thus has also been described as "superficial zone protein", or SZP); however, defined interactions responsible for lubricin retention at this site are not well characterized. In the current studies, we identified molecular determinants that enable lubricin to effectively bind to articular cartilage surfaces. Efficient and specific binding to the superficial zone was observed for synovial lubricin, as well as for recombinant full-length lubricin and a protein construct comprising the lubricin C-terminal (hemopexin-like) domain (LUB-C, encoded by exons 7-12). A construct representing the N-terminal region of lubricin (LUB-N, encoded by exons 2-5) exhibited no appreciable cartilage-binding ability, but displayed the capacity to dimerize, and thus potentially influence lubricin aggregation. Disulfide bond disruption significantly attenuated recombinant lubricin and LUB-C binding to cartilage surfaces, demonstrating a requirement for protein secondary structure in facilitating the appropriate localization of lubricin at relevant tissue interfaces. These findings help identify additional key attributes contributing to lubricin functionality, which would be expected to be instrumental in maintaining joint homeostasis.},

abstract = {Mechanical stress is an important regulator of chondrocyte functions but the mechanisms by which chondrocytes sense mechanical signals are unknown. Receptors for matrix molecules are likely involved in the mechanical signaling. In the first part of this study we identified integrins with affinity for the cartilage-specific collagen type II. We report that the collagen-binding integrins alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 2 beta 1 isolated from bovine chondrocytes or human chondrosarcoma cells bound collagen type II as judged from affinity chromatography. The integrins alpha 3 beta 1 or alpha 9 beta 1 did not bind collagen type II-Sepharose. In the second part of the study we investigated the effect of mechanical stress on expression of matrix molecules and integrin subunits. Chondrocytes and chondrosarcoma cells, cultured on uncoated flexible silicone membranes in the presence of serum, were exposed to mechanical stress by the Flexercell system. Dynamic stimulation of chondrocytes for 3 h increased the mRNA expression of collagen type II and aggrecan as judged by Northern blotting, while the beta 1-integrin subunit was not changed. When chondrosarcoma cells were exposed to mechanical stimulation under the same conditions, mRNA expression of alpha 5 was found to increase while beta 1, alpha 2, and alpha v did not increase to significant levels. In another study the effect of mechanical stress on integrins was investigated when the cells were cultured on collagen type II-coated flex-dishes. Three hours of dynamic stress increased the mRNA expression of alpha 2-integrin subunit while the level of mRNA for integrin subunits beta 1, alpha 1, alpha 5, and alpha v showed no or small changes, indicating that matrix components may modulate the expression of integrins during mechanical stress.},

Consequently, there is increasing interest in collecting information on the range and frequency of teaching practices at department-wide and institution-wide scales. To help facilitate this process, we present a new classroom observation protocol known as the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM or COPUS. This protocol allows STEM faculty, after a short 1.5-hour training period, to reliably characterize how faculty and students are spending their time in the classroom. We present the protocol, discuss how it differs from existing classroom observation protocols, and describe the process by which it was developed and validated. We also discuss how the observation data can be used to guide individual and institutional change.},

abstract = {The so-called "marrow stimulating" technique of microfracture uses an awl to penetrate the subchondral bone in cartilage defects. Disruption of the subchondral bone induces fibrin clot formation in the area of the chondral defect. This clot contains pluripotent, marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, which are able to differentiate into fibrochondrocytes, resulting in a fibrocartilage repair with varying amounts of type I, II, and III collagen content. Microfracture is a single-stage procedure that is ideally suited for small, well-contained, Outerbridge grade 3 to 4 cartilage lesions. Most clinical studies of the outcomes after microfracture in the knee show improvement in knee function in 70% to 90% of patients. The long-term results vary. Almost all studies report significant improvement in the first year after surgery; some report a decline in activity levels after 1 year, especially in elite athletes. Other studies have shown a continuation of good results for up to 7 years. Recent studies have shown that a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2) and incomplete fibrocartilage fill of a lesion as observed on MRI correlate with a poor outcome. The technical simplicity of the procedure, cost-effectiveness, and relatively low patient morbidity make microfracture an invaluable tool for the treatment of small full-thickness cartilage lesions. Microfracture is a good first-line procedure because it does not prevent the application of other cartilage repair procedures that may be needed in the future.},

abstract = {Mechanical loading of articular cartilage stimulates the metabolism of resident chondrocytes and induces the synthesis of molecules to maintain the integrity of the cartilage. Mechanical signals modulate biochemical activity and changes in cell behavior through mechanotransduction. Compression of cartilage results in complex changes within the tissue including matrix and cell deformation, hydrostatic and osmotic pressure, fluid flow, altered matrix water content, ion concentration and fixed charge density. These changes are detected by mechanoreceptors on the cell surface, which include mechanosensitive ion channels and integrins that on activation initiate intracellular signalling cascades leading to tissue remodelling. Excessive mechanical loading also influences chondrocyte metabolism but unlike physiological stimulation leads to a quantitative imbalance between anabolic and catabolic activity resulting in depletion of matrix components. In this article we focus on the role of mechanical signalling in the maintenance of articular cartilage, and discuss how alterations in normal signalling can lead to pathology.},

The integrity of this matrix is crucial for the biomechanical properties of the joint cartilage. The different components of the matrix are synthesized and degraded by the cartilage cells, a process regulated by the amount of mechanical stress applied to the chondrocytes as well as by peptide factors and hormones present in synovial fluid. The proteoglycans are large macromolecules consisting of a protein core to which are attached multiple chains of glycosaminoglycans and oligosaccharides. During normal and pathological turnover, degradation products are released to the synovial fluid and to the circulation. Newly developed assays allow the sensitive and specific detection of these fragments in joint fluid and serum. Results of experimental and clinical investigations suggest that these assays will be of value in efforts to diagnose, grade and predict the outcome of inflammatory and degenerative joint disease.},

As expected, the new course helped students to understand the interaction idea of the force concept, whereas the idea of relating force to motion remained common even after the course.

abstract = {Articular cartilage is a highly efficacious water-based tribological system that is optimized to provide low friction and wear protection at both low and high loads (pressures) and sliding velocities that must last over a lifetime. Although many different lubrication mechanisms have been proposed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the tribological performance of cartilage cannot be attributed to a single mechanism acting alone but on the synergistic action of multiple "modes" of lubrication that are adapted to provide optimum lubrication as the normal loads, shear stresses, and rates change. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid and widely thought to play a principal role in joint lubrication although this role remains unclear. HA is also known to complex readily with the glycoprotein lubricin (LUB) to form a cross-linked network that has also been shown to be critical to the wear prevention mechanism of joints. Friction experiments on porcine cartilage using the surface forces apparatus, and enzymatic digestion, reveal an "adaptive" role for an HA-LUB complex whereby, under compression, nominally free HA diffusing out of the cartilage becomes mechanically, i.e., physically, trapped at the interface by the increasingly constricted collagen pore network. The mechanically trapped HA-LUB complex now acts as an effective (chemically bound) "boundary lubricant"--reducing the friction force slightly but, more importantly, eliminating wear damage to the rubbing/shearing surfaces. This paper focuses on the contribution of HA in cartilage lubrication; however, the system as a whole requires both HA and LUB to function optimally under all conditions.},

In the near future, engineered tissues will be able to withstand and support the physiological compressive and tensile forces in weight-bearing synovial joints such as the knee. However, there is an increasing realization that these tissue-engineered cartilage constructs will fail without the optimal frictional and wear properties present in native articular cartilage. These characteristics are critical to smooth, pain-free joint articulation and a long-lasting, durable cartilage surface.

abstract = {At a time when prevalence of osteoarthritis (failure of the joint) is increasing with an aging population it is timely to review the latest evidence and management strategies for optimal treatment of patients with this, the most common joint disease of mankind. A number of exciting new developments related to etiopathogesis and management make it highly desirable at this time to publish a fully comprehensive authoritative discussion of the risk factors, mechanisms of joint damage, clinical aspects, differential diagnosis and treatment of OA. A review of the current understanding of the management of this disorder and of the basic mechanisms involved provides the rationale for publication of this new fully-updated edition. The book looks at the mechanisms for joint failure and how this may be due to abnormal cartilage or disease in underlying tissue. Significant coverage is given to exciting new evidence on disease-modifying drugs and methodologies for their outcomes evaluation. It is becoming increasingly reconised that optimal management of osteoarthritis requires a comprehensive program involving drugs and nonmedical components and, in some cases, surgery. Chapters on both non-surgical and surgical therapy are contained in the management section. The full coverage given in this book allows the physician to consider and choose the right blend of treatment for each patient from the range available whether physical, pharmacologic, surgical or supportive. The book is sympathetic to the significant differences that often exist between the perception of the patient and that of the physician regardign what's important in treatment and coverage is therefore given to the outcome measures needed for optimal evaluation of both. Highly illustrated in full colour throughout this definitive text is written principally for the clinical rheumatologists, although primary care physicians, orthopaedic surgeons, allied health professionals, basic researchers, members of the pharmaceutical industry who are involved in drug research and development, and regulatory staff should also find it useful.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage shows little or no intrinsic capacity for repair in response to injury or disease, and even minor lesions or injuries may lead to progressive damage and joint degeneration. Tissue engineering is a relatively new but rapidly growing field that has sought to use combinations of implanted cells, biomaterials, and biologically active molecules to repair or regenerate injured or diseased tissues. Despite many advances, tissue engineers have faced significant challenges in repairing or replacing tissues that serve a predominantly biomechanical function, such as articular cartilage. An evolving discipline termed functional tissue engineering seeks to address these challenges by emphasizing and evaluating the role of biomechanical factors in the intrinsic and engineered repair of tissues and organs. In the current study, the authors describe some of the fundamental issues involving the interaction of biomechanical stresses in vivo and in vitro with native and repair articular cartilage and with other biomechanically functional tissues. A more thorough and formal investigation of these issues may provide a basis for developing rational design principles for tissue engineered replacement or repair of load-bearing structures in the body.},

abstract = {The cytoskeleton is known to play an important role in the biomechanical nature and structure of cells, but its particular function in compressive characteristics has not yet been fully examined. This study focused on the contribution of the main three cytoskeletal elements to the bulk compressive stiffness (as measured by the compressive modulus), volumetric or apparent compressibility changes (as further indicated by apparent Poisson's ratio), and recovery behavior of individual chondrocytes. Before mechanical testing, cytochalasin D, acrylamide, or colchicine was used to disrupt actin microfilaments, intermediate filaments, or microtubules, respectively. Cells were subjected to a range of compressive strains and allowed to recover to equilibrium. Analysis of the video recording for each mechanical event yielded relevant compressive properties and recovery characteristics related to the specific cytoskeletal disrupting agent and as a function of applied axial strain. Inhibition of actin microfilaments had the greatest effect on bulk compressive stiffness ( approximately 50% decrease compared to control). Meanwhile, intermediate filaments and microtubules were each found to play an integral role in either the diminution (compressibility) or retention (incompressibility) of original cell volume during compression. In addition, microtubule disruption had the largest effect on the "critical strain threshold" in cellular mechanical behavior (33% decrease compared to control), as well as the characteristic time for recovery ( approximately 100% increase compared to control). Elucidating the role of the cytoskeleton in the compressive biomechanical behavior of single cells is an important step toward understanding the basis of mechanotransduction and the etiology of cellular disease processes.},

abstract = {Mechanical stress-induced matrix deformation plays a fundamental role in regulating cellular activities; however, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. To understand the effects of matrix deformation on chondrocytes, we characterized primary chondrocytes cultured on three-dimensional collagen scaffoldings, which can be loaded mechanically with a computer-controlled "Bio-Stretch" device. Cyclic matrix deformation greatly stimulated proliferation of immature chondrocytes, but not that of hypertrophic chondrocytes. This indicates that mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation is developmental stage specific. Synthesis of cartilage matrix protein (CMP/matrilin-1), a mature chondrocyte marker, and type X collagen, a hypertrophic chondrocyte marker, was up-regulated by stretch-induced matrix deformation. Therefore, genes of CMP and type X collagen are responsive to mechanical stress. Mechanical stimulation of the mRNA levels of CMP and type X collagen occurred exactly at the same time points when these markers were synthesized by nonloading cells. This indicates that cyclic matrix deformation does not alter the speed of differentiation, but affects the extent of differentiation. The addition of the stretch-activated channel blocker gadolinium during loading abolished mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation, but did not affect the up-regulation of CMP mRNA by mechanical stretch. In contrast, the calcium channel blocker nifedipine inhibited both the stretch-induced proliferation and the increase of CMP mRNA. This suggests that stretch-induced matrix deformation regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation via two signal transduction pathways, with stretch-activated channels involved in transducing the proliferative signals and calcium channels involved in transducing the signals for both proliferation and differentiation.},

abstract = {Cartilage regeneration based on isolated and culture-expanded chondrocytes is studied in a variety of in vitro models, but with varying morphological quality of tissue synthesized. The goal of the present study was to investigate the extent of the influence of expansion and redifferentiation conditions on final tissue morphology by comparing 2 expansion and redifferentiation methods. Chondrocytes from 9 human donors were expanded in medium without growth factor supplementation (basic expansion condition [BEC]) or in medium with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) supplementation (growth factor supplemented expansion condition [GFSEC]). After expansion, cells were either redifferentiated in pellet culture or seeded on collagen type II-coated filters. Post-expansion mRNA levels of collagen type I and II and Sox-5, -6, and 9, measured by semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), suggested that expansion in GFSEC results in increased dedifferentiation compared to BEC. However, after 28 days of redifferentiation culture, morphology of tissue synthesized by GFSEC-expanded chondrocytes scored significantly higher on the Bern scale compared to BEC (6.4 +/- 0.3 points vs. 4.5 +/- 0.3 points in pellet culture and 6.0 +/- 0.4 points vs. 4.5 +/- 0.3 points on collagen-coated filters; p < 0.05). Expansion in GFSEC compared to BEC increased proteoglycan (PG) synthesis rate at day 9 (4.0-fold in pellet culture and 1.9-fold on collagen-coated filters; p < 0.01), PG release (6.7-fold in pellet culture and 3.2-fold on collagen-coated filters; p < 0.001), and final PG content at day 28 (1.6-fold in pellet culture and 1.5-fold on collagen-coated filters; p < 0.05). Redifferentiation on collagen-coated filters compared to pellet culture increased PG synthesis rate at day 9 (5.2-fold in BEC-expanded chondrocytes and 2.6-fold in GFSEC-expanded chondrocytes; p < 0.01), PG release (4.2-fold in BEC-expanded chondrocytes and 3.1-fold in GFSECexpanded chondrocytes; p < 0.01), and final PG content (1.3-fold in BEC-expanded chondrocytes and 1.9- fold in GFSEC-expanded chondrocytes; p < 0.01). Moreover, as visualized via electron microscopy, chondrocytes and organization of extracellular matrix cultured on filters was more similar to those found for hyaline cartilage. In conclusion, chondrocyte expansion in GFSEC and redifferentiation on collagen-coated filters resulted in most optimal chondrogenesis.},

It includes additional discussion of important foundational issues as well as practical forms and ideas gleaned from disciplinary groups and campuses throughout the nation.Like the first edition of Peer Review of Teaching, this new edition is offered in the hope that providing examples and suggestions will not reduce the important work of peer review to mere forms or rigid procedures, but will empower faculty to articulate criteria and standards, perform the reviews systematically and thoughtfully, and realize that engaging in peer review is an approachable and worthwhile professionaltask. Updated to reflect the emphasis on student learning as the ultimate goal of college teaching, it incorporates new ideas and references from the literature. The most notable change in this edition is a discussion of peer review within special contexts for teaching, such as clinics, studios, and practice settings. The turn to active engagement in learning has also led to increased use of problem-based learning, the case study method, and other approaches that traditional forms for peer review do not address. Similarly, the explosion of the use of instructional technology calls for an articulation of new approaches to evaluating web-basedinstruction.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage has unique material properties that enable the cartilage to perform its physiological functions over a lifetime and under a wide range of loading conditions. Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between cartilage properties and composition/structure. For cartilage transplantation and regeneration, it is necessary to know how cartilage maintains its functionality and how cartilage responds to the ever-changing mechanical environment. In this review, we discuss theoretical and experimental studies on the behavior of articular cartilage to load. In the first part, the composition and structure of articular cartilage is presented. In the second part, theoretical models of the mechanical behavior of cartilage, experimental methods for the determination of cartilage properties, and material properties for normal, pathologic, and repair cartilage are summarized. In the third part, the relationship between mechanical loading of the cells and their corresponding biological responses are discussed. The goal for treating joint degeneration in the future lies in cartilage regeneration rather than prosthetic replacement. In order to achieve this goal, it has to be understood how structure and function, metabolic and biochemical properties, and biomechanical performance of articular cartilage can be restored.},

The early work regarding research-level threshold concepts is further developed and reported in this paper using research carried out with supervisors into their identification of threshold concepts and research students' crossing of these thresholds. The research was conducted in two stages involving 65 experienced research supervisors across six countries (Australia, England, Jamaica, Malaysia, New Zealand and Trinidad) and across Humanities, Social Sciences, Engineering and IT and the Sciences. The first stage involved written responses from 26 experienced supervisors related to the learning challenges experienced by research students and their supervisors.

abstract = {Superficial zone protein (SZP) has been demonstrated to contribute to the boundary lubrication in synovial joints. This study was designed to clarify the modulation of SZP expression by mechanical stress in articular chondrocytes. Cyclic tensile strains of 7 and 21% cell elongation were applied to cultured chondrocytes obtained from porcine mandibular condylar cartilage. The mRNA levels of SZP, IL-1 beta, and TGF-beta1 were examined by a quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Protein level of SZP was examined by Western blotting. The SZP mRNA level was significantly upregulated after 12, 24, and 48 h by 7% elongation. Although SZP mRNA level was upregulated by 21% elongation after 12 h, it decreased to a lower level than the control after 48 h. The TGF-beta1 mRNA level exhibited an almost similar change to SZP. The IL-1 beta mRNA level was not changed markedly by 7% elongation. However, the IL-1 beta mRNA level was significantly increased by a 12-h application of 21% elongation. Western blot analysis revealed that the SZP expression was increased by 7% elongation, but decreased remarkably by 21% elongation. It is suggested from these findings that the SZP expression level in the chondrocytes is enhanced by optimal mechanical stimuli, but inhibited by excessive loading partly affected by TGF-beta1 and IL-1 beta, leading to the deterioration of joint lubrication.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage has distinct histological depth zones. In each zone, chondrocytes are subject to different hydrostatic (HP) and osmotic pressure (OP) due to weight-bearing and joint-loading. Previous in vitro studies of regeneration and pathophysiology in cartilage have failed to consider the characteristics of histological heterogeneity and the effects of combinations of changes in HP and OP. Thus, we have constructed molecular, biochemical, and histological profiles of anabolic and catabolic molecules produced by chondrocytes from each depth zone isolated from bovine articular cartilage in response to changes in HP and OP. We cultured the chondrocytes with combinations of loading or off-loading of HP at 0-0.5 MPa, 0.5 Hz, and changes in OP of 300-450 mosM over 1 wk, and evaluated mRNA expression and immunohistology of both anabolic and catabolic molecules and amounts of accumulated sulfated glycosaminoglycan. Any changes in HP and OP upregulated mRNA of anabolic and catabolic molecules in surface-, middle-, and deep-zone cells, in descending order of magnitude. Off-loading HP maintained the anabolic and reduced the catabolic mRNA; high OP retained upregulation of catabolic mRNA. These molecular profiles were consistent with immunohistological and biochemical findings. Changes in HP and OP are essential for simulating chondrocyte physiology and useful for manipulating phenotypes.},

There is a macrofibrillar collagen network and a microfilamentous network about which other noncollagenous molecules are organized. Its structure and composition are reflective of its special mechanical properties that primarily reflect its tensile strength (collagens) and compressive stiffness (proteoglycan aggrecan) and cell-matrix interactions (noncollagenous proteins).},

abstract = {One goal of treatment for large articular cartilage defects is to restore the anatomic contour of the joint with tissue having a structure similar to native cartilage. Shaped and stratified cartilaginous tissue may be fabricated into a suitable graft to achieve such restoration. We asked if scaffold-free cartilaginous constructs, anatomically shaped and targeting spherically-shaped hips, can be created using a molding technique and if biomimetic stratification of the shaped constructs can be achieved with appropriate superficial and middle/deep zone chondrocyte subpopulations. The shaped, scaffold-free constructs were formed from the alginate-released bovine calf chondrocytes with shaping on one (saucer), two (cup), or neither (disk) surfaces. The saucer and cup constructs had shapes distinguishable quantitatively (radius of curvature of 5.5 +/- 0.1 mm for saucer and 2.8 +/- 0.1 mm for cup) and had no adverse effects on the glycosaminoglycan and collagen contents and their distribution in the constructs as assessed by biochemical assays and histology, respectively. Biomimetic stratification of chondrocyte subpopulations in saucer- and cup-shaped constructs was confirmed and quantified using fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. This shaping method, combined with biomimetic stratification, has the potential to create anatomically contoured large cartilaginous constructs.},

abstract = {This study formulates and implements a finite element contact algorithm for solid-fluid (biphasic) mixtures, accommodating both finite deformation and sliding. The finite element source code is made available to the general public. The algorithm uses a penalty method regularized with an augmented Lagrangian method to enforce the continuity of contact traction and normal component of fluid flux across the contact interface. The formulation addresses the need to automatically enforce free-draining conditions outside of the contact interface. The accuracy of the implementation is verified using contact problems, for which exact solutions are obtained by alternative analyses. Illustrations are also provided that demonstrate large deformations and sliding under configurations relevant to biomechanical applications such as articular contact. This study addresses an important computational need in the biomechanics of porous-permeable soft tissues. Placing the source code in the public domain provides a useful resource to the biomechanics community.},

abstract = {Today, the most frequent chronic musculoskeletal disorder and the leading cause of disability in the elderly is osteoarthritis (OA). Approximately 43 million people in the United States and 15% of the world population are affected. Due to demographic changes, the incidence of OA is rapidly increasing, leading to an ascending socioeconomical and personal burden. Despite the exact cause of OA remains unknown, the pathogenic role of biomechanical dysfunction in OA is well established. For weight-bearing joints altered loading mechanisms, increased mechanical forces and changed biomechanics are significant contributing factors for initiation and progression of OA. Thus, OA is a disease of the whole joint, including muscles, tendons, ligaments, synovium and bone. This review focuses on the influence of biomechanics on the pathogenesis and progression of OA. We notably illustrate the pathological bioreactivity of soft tissues, subchondral bone and joint inflammation. Procedures, conservative or surgical, which actively alter the biomechanics of the lower limb, are promising strategies to treat symptoms as well as to influence disease progression in OA.},

abstract = {The field of learning analytics has the potential to enable higher education institutions to increase their understanding of their students{\textquoteright} learning needs and to use that understanding to positively influence student learning and progression. Analysis of data relating to students and their engagement with their learning is the foundation of this process. There is an inherent assumption linked to learning analytics that knowledge of a learner{\textquoteright}s behavior is advantageous for the individual, instructor and educational provider. It seems intuitively obvious that a greater understanding of a student cohort and of the learning designs and interventions to which they best respond would be of benefit to students and, in turn, for the retention and success rate of the institution. Yet, such collection of data and its use faces a number of ethical challenges, including issues of the location and interpretation of data; informed consent, privacy and the de-identification of data; and the classification and management of data. 

Approaches taken to understand the opportunities and ethical challenges of learning analytics necessarily depend on a range of ideological assumptions and epistemologies. This paper proposes a socio-critical perspective on the use of learning analytics. Such an approach highlights the role of power, the impact of surveillance, the need for transparency and an acknowledgment that student identity is a transient, temporal and context-bound construct. Each of these affects the scope and definition of the ethical use of learning analytics. We propose six principles as a framework for a number of considerations to guide higher education institutions to address ethical issues in learning analytics and challenges in context-dependent and appropriate ways.

abstract = {The inferior biomechanical properties of in vitro-formed tissue remain a significant obstacle in bioengineering articular cartilage tissue. We have previously shown that cyclic compression (30 minutes, 1 kPa, 1 Hz) of chondrocytes isolated from full-thickness cartilage can induce greater matrix synthesis, although articular cartilage is composed of different subpopulations of chondrocytes, and their individual contribution to enhanced tissue formation has not been fully characterized. This study examines the contribution of chondrocyte subpopulations to this response. Bovine articular chondrocytes were isolated from superficial to mid zones (SMZs) or deep zones (DZs), placed in three-dimensional culture, and subjected to cyclic compression. DZ chondrocytes on calcium polyphosphate substrates formed thicker tissue than those from SMZs. Compression increased matrix accumulation in SMZ chondrocytes while decreasing accumulation in DZ chondrocytes. The SMZ and DZ chondrocytes also differed in their type 1 membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and MMP-13 expression, enzymes that play a crucial role in mediating the response to mechanical stimulation. In addition, the duration of the culture period was important in determining the DZ response, raising the possibility that matrix accumulation plays a role in the response to stimulation. Understanding the cellular response to mechanical stimulation during tissue formation will facilitate our understanding of tissue growth and allow for further optimization of cartilage tissue formation in vitro.},

abstract = {A method has been developed to restore cartilage defects by culturing autologous chondrocytes to create a three dimensional tissue and then implanting the cultured tissue. In this kind of approach, it is important to characterize the dynamic mechanical behavior of the regenerated cartilaginous tissue, because these tissues need to bear various dynamic loadings in daily life. The objectives of this study were to evaluate in detail the dynamic viscoelastic responses of chondrocyte-seeded agarose gel cultures in compression and torsion (shear) and to determine the relationships between these mechanical responses and biochemical composition. The results showed that both the dynamic compressive and shear stiffness of the cultured constructs increased during culture. The relative energy dissipation in dynamic compression decreased, whereas that in dynamic shear increased during culture. Furthermore, correlation analyses showed that the sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content of the cultured construct showed significant correlations with the dynamic modulus in both compression and shear situations. On the other hand, the loss tangent in dynamic compression, which represents the relative energy dissipation capability of the constructs, showed a low correlation with the sGAG content, whereas this capability in shear exhibited moderate correlation. In conclusion, we explored the dynamic viscoelasticity of the tissue-engineered cartilage in dynamic compression and shear, and determined correlations between viscoelasticity and biochemical composition.},

Lubrication was measured under boundary conditions as lowering of the coefficient of friction (mu) between oscillating natural latex and polished glass. Lubricating ability was first observed at a concentration of 200 micrograms/ml and became maximal at 260 micrograms/ml. Hydrophobic interfacial tension measurements indicated that at the former concentration, monolayers of PSLF formed. Sugar digestions showed that lubricating ability depends upon the terminal galactose of the molecule. PSLF is similar if not identical to lubricin. It is proposed that a repulsive hydration force is the molecular mechanism for lubricating activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To establish whether chondrocytes from normal and osteoarthritic human articular cartilage recognize and respond to pressure induced mechanical strain in a similar manner.

DESIGN:Chondrocytes, extracted from macroscopically normal and osteoarthritic human articular cartilage obtained from knee joints at autopsy, were grown in monolayer culture and subjected to cyclical pressure-induced strain (PIS) in the absence or presence of anti-integrin antibodies, agents known to block ion channels and inhibitors of key molecules involved in the integrin-associated signalling pathways. The response of the cells to mechanical stimulation was assessed by measuring changes in membrane potential.

RESULTS:Unlike chondrocytes from normal articular cartilage, which showed a membrane hyperpolarization response to PIS, chondrocytes from osteoarthritic cartilage responded by membrane depolarization. The mechanotransduction pathway involves alpha5beta1 integrins, stretch-activated ion channels, tyrosine kinases and phospholipase C but the actin cytoskeleton and protein kinase C, which are important in the membrane hyperpolarization response in normal chondrocytes, are not necessary for membrane depolarization in osteoarthritic chondrocytes in response to PIS.

CONCLUSION:Chondrocytes derived from osteoarthritic cartilage show a different signalling pathway via alpha5beta1 integrin in response to mechanical stimulation which may be of importance in the production of phenotypic changes recognized to be present in diseased cartilage.},

In many cases, the molecules' function is unclear, but the importance of others is illustrated by their involvement in genetic disorders. This review provides a selective survey of these molecules and discusses their structure, function, and involvement in inherited and arthritic disorders.},

abstract = {The Cambridge Handbook of Engineering Education Research is the critical reference source for the growing field of engineering education research, featuring the work of world luminaries writing to define and inform this emerging field. The Handbook draws extensively on contemporary research in the learning sciences, examining how technology affects learners and learning environments, and the role of social context in learning. Since a landmark issue of the Journal of Engineering Education (2005), in which senior scholars argued for a stronger theoretical and empirically driven agenda, engineering education has quickly emerged as a research-driven field increasing in both theoretical and empirical work drawing on many social science disciplines, disciplinary engineering knowledge, and computing. The Handbook is based on the research agenda from a series of interdisciplinary colloquia funded by the US National Science Foundation and published in the Journal of Engineering Education in October 2006.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To review the current knowledge of the mechanism of DNA methylation, its association with transcriptional silencing, possible mechanisms of hyper- and hypomethylation and how epigenetic changes may relate to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA).

METHODS:Journal literature was searched using Pubmed. Since there are very few publications directly on epigenetic phenomena in OA, the search was extended to give an overview of epigenetic mechanisms as they relate to the molecular mechanisms of the disease.

RESULTS:While the epigenetics of cancer cells have been intensively investigated, little attention has so far been paid as to whether epigenetic changes contribute to the pathology of non-neoplastic diseases such as OA. This review explains the mechanisms of DNA methylation, its role in transcriptional regulation, and possible demethylation mechanisms that may be applicable to OA. Preliminary evidence suggests that changes in DNA methylation, together with cytokines, growth factors and changes in matrix composition, are likely to be important in determining the complex gene expression patterns that are observed in osteoarthritic chondrocytes.

CONCLUSION:Early evidence points to a role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of OA. Since epigenetic changes, although heritable at the cellular level, are potentially reversible, epigenetics could be a new molecular target for therapeutic intervention, especially early in the disease.},

These tasks are open-ended modeling problems that introduce advanced engineering content yet are suitable for undergraduate engineering students. In this paper, we will give a personal account of the research and development of the nano roughness MEA. We will focus on the attainment of the six principles that guide the development of an MEA and the main development challenges: identifying aspects of an advanced engineering topic suitable for undergraduate students, making the task realistic, creating the need for team interaction, making the model reusable in similar situations, and preparing for task implementation in the classroom.

abstract = {The compressive viscoelastic behavior of articular cartilage, a fiber-reinforced, porous, permeable solid matrix filled with water, is predominately governed by the flow of the interstitial water within the tissue and its exudation across the articular surface. The fluid flow is in turn governed by the permeability of the tissue and the loading imposed upon its surface. But for articular cartilage, the permeability depends nonlinearly on the strain; k = ko exp (Me). Here, M is the nonlinear flow-limiting parameter and e is the dilatation. In this investigation, we studied the influence of M and Ro = koHA/Uh (where HA is the elastic equilibrium modulus of the solid matrix, h is the tissue's thickness and U is the rate of compression applied onto the surface via a rigid, porous, free-draining filter) on the stress history of circular plugs of cartilage specimens attached to the bone. It was found that these two parameters have profound effects on the predicted compressive stress history. For very large Ro, the fluid flow effects become negligible. For small Ro and large M, large instantaneous compressive stresses several times larger than those observed at equilibrium are predicted. This amplification of compressive stress is due to the increase of importance of the relative fluid flow effect, i.e., Ro leads to 0, and nonlinear flow-limit effect, i.e., M greater than 0. Also, the theoretical curves predict that the rate of increase of stress initially decreases (convex) and finally becomes a constant. The results of our 5 percent offset compression experiments are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {The temporomandibular joint is critical for jaw movements and allows for mastication, digestion of food, and speech. Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that is marked by permanent cartilage destruction and loss of extracellular matrix (ECM). To understand how the ECM regulates mandibular condylar chondrocyte (MCC) differentiation and function, we used a genetic mouse model of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis that is deficient in two ECM proteins, biglycan and fibromodulin (Bgn(-/0)Fmod(-/-)). Given the unavailability of cell lines, we first isolated primary MCCs and found that they were phenotypically unique from hyaline articular chondrocytes isolated from the knee joint. Using Bgn(-/0) Fmod(-/-) MCCs, we discovered the early basis for temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis arises from abnormal and accelerated chondrogenesis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is a growth factor that is critical for chondrogenesis and binds to both biglycan and fibromodulin. Our studies revealed the sequestration of TGF-beta1 was decreased within the ECM of Bgn(-/0) Fmod(-/-) MCCs, leading to overactive TGF-beta1 signal transduction. Using an explant culture system, we found that overactive TGF-beta1 signals induced chondrogenesis and ECM turnover in this model. We demonstrated for the first time a comprehensive study revealing the importance of the ECM in maintaining the mandibular condylar cartilage integrity and identified biglycan and fibromodulin as novel key players in regulating chondrogenesis and ECM turnover during temoporomandibular joint osteoarthritis pathology.},

abstract = {Tissue engineering of articular cartilage is a promising alternative for cartilage repair. However, it has been difficult to develop tissue in vitro that mimicks native cartilage. Cartilaginous tissue formed in vitro does not accumulate enough extracellular matrix, is deficient in collagen, and possesses only a fraction of the mechanical properties of native cartilage. In this study, we investigated whether long-term intermittent compressive stimulation would improve the quality of the generated tissue. Chondrocyte cultures were established on the surface of porous calcium polyphosphate substrates and allowed to form cartilaginous tissue. In vitro-formed tissues were subjected to different stimulation protocols for 1 week. The optimal mechanical stimulation parameters identified in this short-term study were then applied to the cultures for up to 4 weeks. Mechanical stimulation applied at a 5% compressive amplitude at a frequency of 1 Hz for 400 cycles every second day resulted in the greatest increase in collagen synthesis (37 +/- 9% over control) while not significantly affecting proteoglycan synthesis (2 +/- 8% over control). This condition, applied to the chondrocyte cultures for 4 weeks, resulted in a significant increase in the amount of tissue that formed (stimulated, 2.4 +/- 0.2 mg dry wt; unstimulated, 1.61 +/- 0.08 mg dry wt). Stimulated tissues contained approximately 40% more collagen (stimulated, 590 +/- 58 microg; unstimulated, 420 +/- 42 microg), and 30% more proteoglycans (stimulated, 393 +/- 34 microg; unstimulated, 302 +/- 32 microg) as well as displaying a 2- to 3-fold increase in compressive mechanical properties (maximal equilibrium stress: stimulated, 10 +/- 1 kPa; unstimulated, 5 +/- 1 kPa; maximal equilibrium modulus: stimulated, 80 +/- 23 kPa; unstimulated, 24 +/- 6 kPa). The results of this study demonstrate that intermittent mechanical stimulation can increase collagen synthesis and, when applied over a 4-week period, can accelerate extracellular matrix accumulation as well as improve the material properties of the developed tissue. Interestingly, only short periods of mechanical stimulation (6 min every second day) were needed to affect the quality of cartilaginous tissue formed in vitro.},

abstract = {In dogs, degenerative joint diseases (DJD) have been shown to be associated with increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the synovial fluid. The goal of this study was to examine healthy and degenerative stifle joints in order to clarify the origin of LDH in synovial fluid. In order to assess the distribution of LDH, cartilage samples from healthy and degenerative knee joints were investigated by means of light and transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with immunolabeling and enzyme cytochemistry. Morphological analysis confirmed DJD. All techniques used corroborated the presence of LDH in chondrocytes and in the interterritorial matrix of healthy and degenerative stifle joints. Although enzymatic activity of LDH was clearly demonstrated in the territorial matrix by means of the tetrazolium-formazan reaction, immunolabeling for LDH was missing in this region. With respect to the distribution of LDH in the interterritorial matrix, a striking decrease from superficial to deeper layers was present in healthy dogs but was missing in affected joints. These results support the contention that LDH in synovial fluid of degenerative joints originates from cartilage. Therefore, we suggest that (1) LDH is transferred from chondrocytes to ECM in both healthy dogs and dogs with degenerative joint disease and that (2) in degenerative joints, LDH is released from chondrocytes and the ECM into synovial fluid through abrasion of cartilage as well as through enhanced diffusion as a result of increased water content and degradation of collagen.},

abstract = {Lesions of articular cartilage have a large variety of causes among which traumatic damage, osteoarthritis and osteochondritis dissecans are the most frequent. Replacement of articular defects in joints has assumed greater importance in recent years. This interest results in large part because cartilage defects cannot adequately heal themselves. Many techniques have been suggested over the last 30 years, but none allows the regeneration of the damaged cartilage, i.e. its replacement by a strictly identical tissue. In the first generation of techniques, relief of pain was the main concern, which could be provided by techniques in which cartilage was replaced by fibrocartilage. Disappointing results led investigators to focus on more appropriate bioregenerative approaches using transplantation of autologous cells into the lesion. Unfortunately, none of these approaches has provided a perfect final solution to the problem. The latest generation of techniques, currently in the developmental or preclinical stages, involve biomaterials for the repair of chondral or osteochondral lesions. Many of these scaffolds are designed to be seeded with chondrocytes or progenitor cells. Among natural and synthetic polymers, collagen- and polysaccharide-based biomaterials have been extensively used. For both these supports, studies have shown that chondrocytes maintain their phenotype when cultured in three dimensions. In both types of culture, a glycosaminoglycan-rich deposit is formed on the surface and in the inner region of the cultured cartilage, and type II collagen synthesis is also observed. Dynamic conditions can also improve the composition of such three-dimensional constructs. Many improvements are still required, however, in a number of key aspects that so far have received only scant attention. These aspects include: adhesion/integration of the graft with the adjacent native cartilage, cell-seeding with genetically-modified cell populations, biomaterials that can be implanted without open joint surgery and combined therapies, aimed at disease modification, pain relief and reduction of inflammation.},

abstract = {Determining the depth dependence of the shear properties of articular cartilage is essential for understanding the structure-function relation in this tissue. Here, we measured spatial variations in the shear modulus G of bovine articular cartilage using a novel technique that combines shear testing, confocal imaging and force measurement. We found that G varied by up to two orders of magnitude across a single sample, exhibited a global minimum 50-250 microm below the articular surface in a region just below the superficial zone and was roughly constant at depths > 1000 microm (the "plateau region"). For plateau strains gamma(plateau) approximately 0.75% and overall compressive strains epsilon approximately 5%, G(min) and G(plateau) were approximately 70 and approximately 650 kPa, respectively. In addition, we found that the shear modulus profile depended strongly on the applied shear and axial strains. The greatest change in G occurred at the global minimum where the tissue was highly nonlinear, stiffening under increased shear strain, and weakening under increased compressive strain. Our results can be explained through a simple thought model describing the observed nonlinear behavior in terms of localized buckling of collagen fibers and suggest that compression may decrease the vulnerability of articular cartilage to shear-induced damage by lowering the effective strain on individual collagen fibrils.},

abstract = {Defining how mechanical cues regulate tissue differentiation during skeletal healing can benefit treatment of orthopaedic injuries and may also provide insight into the influence of the mechanical environment on skeletal development. Different global (i.e., organ-level) mechanical loads applied to bone fractures or osteotomies are known to result in different healing outcomes. However, the local stimuli that promote formation of different skeletal tissues have yet to be established. Finite element analyses can estimate local stresses and strains but require many assumptions regarding tissue material properties and boundary conditions. This study used an experimental approach to investigate relationships between the strains experienced by tissues in a mechanically stimulated osteotomy gap and the patterns of tissue differentiation that occur during healing. Strains induced by the applied, global mechanical loads were quantified on the mid-sagittal plane of the callus using digital image correlation. Strain fields were then compared to the distribution of tissue phenotypes, as quantified by histomorphometry, using logistic regression. Significant and consistent associations were found between the strains experienced by a region of the callus and the tissue type present in that region. Specifically, the probability of encountering cartilage increased, and that of encountering woven bone decreased, with increasing octahedral shear strain and, to a lesser extent, maximum principal strain. Volumetric strain was the least consistent predictor of tissue type, although towards the end of the four-week stimulation timecourse, cartilage was associated with increasingly negative volumetric strains. These results indicate that shear strain may be an important regulator of tissue fate during skeletal healing.},

abstract = {The differential effects of static compression and recovery from compression on biosynthesis and biosynthetic pathways of aggrecan, link protein, and hyaluronan were assessed. During compression, biosynthesis of aggrecan and link protein were inhibited to approximately 25 and approximately 40%, respectively, of free-swelling control levels. In marked contrast, hyaluronan synthesis was unaffected by static compression. After release from 12-h 50% static compression, aggrecan synthesis remained inhibited for up to 2.5 days; however, link protein synthesis completely recovered to free-swelling control levels within 8 h after release. Hyaluronan synthesis remained at control levels after release of compression. During compression, aggrecan core protein pool size was decreased, whereas the rate of processing into the proteoglycan form remained essentially the same as in free swelling control tissue. Four hours after release from compression, aggrecan core protein pool size remained small and the rate of intracellular processing of aggrecan had become slower than that of free swelling control tissue. Due to the altered core-protein processing kinetics, fewer but longer chondroitin sulfate chains were added to the core proteins. Sulfation was not markedly altered. The differential effects of static compression and release on the biosynthesis of aggrecan, link protein, and hyaluronan are similar to the changes in the biosynthetic pathways that are affected in response to IL-1 treatment, suggesting that the response to static compression is not a general inhibition of cellular activity, but appears to be part of a specific transduction mechanism.},

abstract = {Mechanical loading modulates cartilage homeostasis through the control of matrix synthesis and catabolism. However, the mechanotransduction pathways through which chondrocytes detect different loading conditions remain unclear. The present study investigated the influence of cyclic compression on intracellular Ca2+ signalling using the well-characterised chondrocyte-agarose model. Cells labelled with Fluo4 were visualised using confocal microscopy following a period of 10 cycles of compression between 0% and 10% strain. In unstrained agarose constructs, not subjected to cyclic compression, a subpopulation of approximately 45% of chondrocytes exhibited spontaneous global Ca2+ transients with mean transient rise and fall times of 19.4 and 29.4 sec, respectively. Cyclic compression modulated global Ca2+ signalling by increasing the percentage of cells exhibiting Ca2+ transients (population modulation) and/or reducing the rise and fall times of these transients (transient shape modulation). The frequency and strain rate of compression differentially modulated these Ca2+ signalling characteristics providing a potential mechanism through which chondrocytes may distinguish between different loading conditions. Treatment with apyrase, gadolinium and the P2 receptor blockers, suramin and basilen blue, significantly reduced the percentage of cells exhibiting Ca2+ transients following cyclic compression, such that the mechanically induced upregulation of Ca2+ signalling was completely abolished. Thus cyclic compression appears to activate a purinergic pathway involving the release of ATP followed by the activation of P2 receptors causing a combination of extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release. Knowledge of this fundamental cartilage mechanotransduction pathway may lead to improved therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cartilage damage and disease.},

abstract = {We established a sensitive non-radioactive in situ hybridization (ISH) method for the detection of chicken IgG gamma-chain mRNA in paraffin sections. RNA probes were transcribed in vitro from cloned chicken IgG CH1 nucleotide sequences with SP6/T7 RNA polymerases in the presence of DIG-UTP. These probes were used for hybridization and were immunodetected using anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The immunoreactive products were visualized with DAB-H(2)O(2). IgG gamma-chain mRNA-expressing cells were localized in both the spleen and oviductal tissues. This method demonstrated an excellent sensitivity since the ISH signal was clear and the background was negligible. We found that in the spleen IgG gamma-chain mRNA-expressing cells were present mainly in the red pulp, whereas in the oviduct they appeared mainly in the mucosal stroma and not in the mucosal epithelium.},

abstract = {Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) comprise a family of enzymes that cleave protein substrates based on a conserved mechanism involving activation of an active site-bound water molecule by a Zn(2+) ion. Although the catalytic domain of MMPs is structurally highly similar, there are many differences with respect to substrate specificity, cellular and tissue localization, membrane binding and regulation that make this a very versatile family of enzymes with a multitude of physiological functions, many of which are still not fully understood. Essentially, all members of the MMP family have been linked to disease development, notably to cancer metastasis, chronic inflammation and the ensuing tissue damage as well as to neurological disorders. This has stimulated a flurry of studies into MMP inhibitors as therapeutic agents, as well as into measuring MMP levels as diagnostic or prognostic markers. As with most protein families, deciphering the function(s) of MMPs is difficult, as they can modify many proteins. Which of these reactions are physiologically or pathophysiologically relevant is often not clear, although studies on knockout animals, human genetic and epigenetic, as well as biochemical studies using natural or synthetic inhibitors have provided insight to a great extent. In this review, we will give an overview of 23 members of the human MMP family and describe functions, linkages to disease and structural and mechanistic features. MMPs can be grouped into soluble (including matrilysins) and membrane-anchored species. We adhere to the 'MMP nomenclature' and provide the reader with reference to the many, often diverse, names for this enzyme family in the introduction.},

abstract = {The efforts to grow mechanically functional cartilage from human mesenchymal stem cells have not been successful. We report that clinically sized pieces of human cartilage with physiologic stratification and biomechanics can be grown in vitro by recapitulating some aspects of the developmental process of mesenchymal condensation. By exposure to transforming growth factor-$\beta$, mesenchymal stem cells were induced to condense into cellular bodies, undergo chondrogenic differentiation, and form cartilagenous tissue, in a process designed to mimic mesenchymal condensation leading into chondrogenesis. We discovered that the condensed mesenchymal cell bodies (CMBs) formed in vitro set an outer boundary after 5 d of culture, as indicated by the expression of mesenchymal condensation genes and deposition of tenascin. Before setting of boundaries, the CMBs could be fused into homogenous cellular aggregates giving rise to well-differentiated and mechanically functional cartilage. We used the mesenchymal condensation and fusion of CMBs to grow centimeter-sized, anatomically shaped pieces of human articular cartilage over 5 wk of culture. For the first time to our knowledge biomechanical properties of cartilage derived from human mesenchymal cells were comparable to native cartilage, with the Young's modulus of >800 kPa and equilibrium friction coeffcient of <0.3. We also demonstrate that CMBs have capability to form mechanically strong cartilage-cartilage interface in an in vitro cartilage defect model. The CMBs, which acted as "lego-like" blocks of neocartilage, were capable of assembling into human cartilage with physiologic-like structure and mechanical properties.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Mechanical stimulation is a widely used method to enhance the formation and properties of tissue-engineered cartilage. While studies have evaluated the responsiveness of chondrocytes to mechanical stimuli, little is known about how much stimulation is actually required. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a single application of cyclic loading to chondrocytes on the formation and properties of in vitro-formed tissue.

DESIGN:Isolated bovine articular chondrocytes were seeded on ceramic substrates in 3D culture and subjected to a single application of compressive cyclic loading at 1, 8 or 15 days after seeding. Once the time at which the chondrocytes were most sensitive to mechanical loading was determined, the effect of a single application on the synthesis and accumulation of matrix molecules as well as the mechanical properties of the in vitro-formed cartilage tissue was evaluated.

RESULTS:Chondrocytes were more responsive to cyclic loading applied early in culture. Cyclic forces applied 24 h after the cultures were established increased collagen and proteoglycan syntheses (48 +/- 11% and 49 +/- 11%, respectively). This single application of cyclic loading also increased the accumulation of collagen (stimulated: 207 +/- 20 microg, control: 173 +/- 9 microg) and proteoglycans (stimulated: 302 +/- 24 microg, control: 270 +/- 14 microg) as well as improved the mechanical properties of the in vitro-formed tissue (twofold increase in equilibrium stress and modulus) determined 4 weeks after the applied stimulus.

CONCLUSIONS:A single application of cyclic loading to chondrocytes early in culture increased matrix accumulation and enhanced the mechanical properties of the in vitro-formed tissue. This suggests that mechanical forces do not have to be applied intermittently over long periods of time to accelerate in vitro tissue formation.},

In this study, chondrocytes from the uppermost 15-20% (superficial cells) and the remaining tissue (deep cells) from bovine articular cartilage were isolated separately and cultured in agarose constructs. Cell deformation on application of a 15% static compressive strain was identical for both subpopulations after 24 and 72 hours in culture. The constructs were incubated under static and dynamic (0.3, 1, and 3 Hz) strains of 15% amplitude. Glycosaminoglycan synthesis by deep cells was unaffected by static strain or 3 Hz dynamic strain, whereas 0.3 Hz produced a significant reduction and 1 Hz induced a highly significant 50% stimulation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis (p < 0.001). Superficial cells exhibited a general inhibition of glycosaminoglycan synthesis. By contrast, proliferation of superficial cells was stimulated by dynamic strain whereas deep cells were not influenced. It has been suggested previously that mechanotransduction-induced controls of glycosaminoglycan synthesis and proliferation in chondrocytes embedded in agarose are uncoupled. Data presented in this study demonstrate that the two processes do, in fact, occur in different subpopulations of chondrocytes within the full-depth cell isolate.},

Dynamic loading of cartilage is associated with slight cell and tissue deformation as well as cyclical fluctuations in the hydrostatic pressure of cartilage and in fluid movement. Static loading results in expression of fluid from the tissue, concentrating extracellular matrix macromolecules and consequently increasing the concentrations of cations, reducing extracellular pH and increasing extracellular osmolarity. Each of these alterations is implicated in regulating the synthetic response of chondrocytes to load. However, the mechanisms by which these changes affect matrix turnover are poorly understood. In this review we consider how load may affect chondrocyte behaviour through its influence on membrane transport processes and thus on the intracellular environment.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Chondrocytes in articular cartilage utilize mechanical signals to regulate their metabolic activity. A fundamental step in determining the role of various biophysical factors in this process is to characterize the local mechanical environment of the chondrocyte under physiological loading.

METHODS:A combined experimental and theoretical approach was used to quantify the in-situ mechanical environment of the chondrocyte. The mechanical properties of enzymatically-isolated chondrocytes and their pericellular matrix (PCM) were determined using micropipette aspiration. The values were used in a finite element model of the chondron (the chondrocyte and its PCM) within articular cartilage to predict the stress-strain and fluid flow microenvironment of the cell. The theoretical predictions were validated using three-dimensional confocal microscopy of chondrocyte deformation in situ.

RESULTS:Chondrocytes were found to behave as a viscoelastic solid material with a Young's modulus of approximately 0.6 kPa. The elastic modulus of the PCM was significantly higher than that of the chondrocyte, but several orders of magnitude lower than that of the extracellular matrix. Theoretical modeling of cell-matrix interactions suggests the mechanical environment of the chondrocyte is highly non-uniform and is dependent on the viscoelastic properties of the PCM. Excellent agreement was observed between the theoretical predictions and the direct measurements of chondrocyte deformation, but only if the model incorporated the PCM.

CONCLUSIONS:These findings imply that the PCM plays a functional biomechanical role in articular cartilage, and alterations in PCM properties with aging or disease will significantly affect the biophysical environment of the chondrocyte.},

This layer could be peeled away as a thin film, with no broken collagen fibrils on its inferior surface or on the surface of subjacent cartilage layers. The orientation and diameter of collagen fibrils were different on these two surfaces. Our findings suggest that the most superficial layer is an independent one which is only loosely connected to the fibrous structure in the layer deep to it.},

abstract = {Extracellular matrix metabolism plays a central role in development of skeletal tissues and in most orthopaedic diseases and trauma such as fracture or osteotomy repair, arthritis, cartilage repair, and congenital skeletal deformity. During development or disease, specific genes must be expressed in order to make or repair appropriate extracellular matrix. For example, specific gene expression patterns are characteristic of bone and cartilage. The precise expression pattern depends on a balance of positive and negative transcription factors, proteins that control the synthesis of mRNA from the specific gene. In cartilage, a number of studies indicate that Sox transcription factors are critical positive regulators in genes such as COL2A1, COL9A2, COL11A2, aggrecan, and CD-RAP. In addition, negative regulators are also essential to fine tune gene regulation in chondrocytes and to turn off gene expression in noncartilaginous tissues. Negative transcription factors in cartilage include partial differentialEF-1, snail/slug, CYRBP1, NT2, and C/EBP. Runx2 and osterix are critical transcription factors for osteogenesis but also have some influence on chondrogenesis. The availability of cis-regulatory sites in specific genes combined with the availability of transcription factors in the nucleus determines the level of gene expression.},

abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is generally a disease of the elderly population, but can occur in young patients in exceptional cases. This study compares the cellular and epigenetic features of primary old-age OA with those of secondary OA in a 23-year-old patient with developmental dysplasia of the hip. In addition, control cartilage from a 14-year-old was compared with that from patients with a fracture of the neck of femur ({\#}NOF) to establish to what extent the latter is a useful control for OA. Articular cartilage was obtained from discarded femoral heads after hip arthroplasty. MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-4 were immunolocalized and the methylation status of specific promoter CpG sites was determined. Both primary and secondary OA were characterized by loss of aggrecan, formation of clones, and abnormal expression of the proteases that correlated with epigenetic DNA demethylation. The latter indicated that the abnormal expression of the cartilage-degrading proteases was not due to a short-term up-regulation, but a heritable, permanent alteration in gene expression. Comparing cell densities in young and old control cartilage estimated an age-related cell loss of approximately 1% per year. In aged {\#}NOF cartilage, some superficial-zone chondrocytes expressed the proteases, but the majority of cells were immunonegative and their promoters were hypermethylated. The cellular and epigenetic features of the intermediate and deep zones of {\#}NOF cartilage are thus similar to those of young healthy cartilage, justifying the use of {\#}NOF cartilage as control cartilage for OA, providing the superficial zone is removed.},

abstract = {The biosynthetic response of calf cartilage disk explants to small-amplitude dynamic compression was studied in radially unconfined compression over a wide range of frequencies. The relative importance of oscillatory fluid flow, hydrostatic pressure, streaming potential, and cell deformation in modulating chondrocyte metabolism was explored by quantifying the frequency dependence and the spatial (radial) distribution of the biosynthetic response within the 3-mm-diameter explant disks. At frequencies greater than 0.001 Hz (cycle/s), dynamic compression increased biosynthesis of proteoglycans and proteins. While compression at frequencies between 0.002 and 0.01 Hz caused a stimulation of biosynthesis that was distributed throughout the disk, compression at 0.1 Hz caused a stimulation that was confined mainly to the outer radial periphery. These distributions were compared to previous estimates of the radial distribution of physical forces and flows within the matrix. The results suggest that the stimulation of chondrocyte biosynthesis by dynamic mechanical compression at amplitudes up to 10% (stresses up to 0.5 MPa) is related to changes in fluid flow and/or cell shape rather than changes in hydrostatic pressure. Since static compression to the original cut thickness caused a slight decrease in biosynthesis in the center of the disks, we also studied the possible role of limited diffusive transport in the marked inhibition of synthesis seen during large displacement static compression. Experiments in which the surface area-to-volume ratio of disks or the concentration of labeling substrate or serum were varied provided no evidence that limited diffusive transport was responsible for the inhibition of biosynthesis by large displacement static compression. Recovery of biosynthesis from static compression and histological analyses of compressed tissue suggested that there was no significant cell damage even during 12 h of 50% static compression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To determine whether the synovial fluid (SF) constituents hyaluronan (HA), proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), and surface-active phospholipids (SAPL) contribute to boundary lubrication, either independently or additively, at an articular cartilage-cartilage interface.

METHODS:Cartilage boundary lubrication tests were performed with fresh bovine osteochondral samples. Tests were performed using graded concentrations of SF, HA, and PRG4 alone, a physiologic concentration of SAPL, and various combinations of HA, PRG4, and SAPL at physiologic concentrations. Static (mu(static, Neq)) and kinetic (<mu(kinetic, Neq)>) friction coefficients were calculated.

RESULTS:Normal SF functioned as an effective boundary lubricant both at a concentration of 100% (<mu(kinetic, Neq)> = 0.025) and at a 3-fold dilution (<mu(kinetic, Neq)> = 0.029). Both HA and PRG4 contributed independently to a low mu in a dose-dependent manner. Values of <mu(kinetic, Neq)> decreased from approximately 0.24 in phosphate buffered saline to 0.12 in 3,300 mug/ml HA and 0.11 in 450 mug/ml PRG4. HA and PRG4 in combination lowered mu further at the high concentrations, attaining a <mu(kinetic, Neq)> value of 0.066. SAPL at 200 mug/ml did not significantly lower mu, either independently or in combination with HA and PRG4.

CONCLUSION:The results described here indicate that SF constituents contribute, individually and in combination, both at physiologic and pathophysiologic concentrations, to the boundary lubrication of apposing articular cartilage surfaces. These results provide insight into the nature of the boundary lubrication of articular cartilage by SF and its constituents. They therefore provide insight regarding both the homeostatic maintenance of healthy joints and pathogenic processes in arthritic disease.},

abstract = {The synovial joint contains synovial fluid (SF) within a cavity bounded by articular cartilage and synovium. SF is a viscous fluid that has lubrication, metabolic, and regulatory functions within synovial joints. SF contains lubricant molecules, including proteoglycan-4 and hyaluronan. SF is an ultrafiltrate of plasma with secreted contributions from cell populations lining and within the synovial joint space, including chondrocytes and synoviocytes. Maintenance of normal SF lubricant composition and function are important for joint homeostasis. In osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and joint injury, changes in lubricant composition and function accompany alterations in the cytokine and growth factor environment and increased fluid and molecular transport through joint tissues. Thus, understanding the synovial joint lubrication system requires a multifaceted study of the various parts of the synovial joint and their interactions. Systems biology approaches at multiple scales are being used to describe the molecular, cellular, and tissue components and their interactions that comprise the functioning synovial joint. Analyses of the transcriptome and proteome of SF, cartilage, and synovium suggest that particular molecules and pathways play important roles in joint homeostasis and disease. Such information may be integrated with physicochemical tissue descriptions to construct integrative models of the synovial joint that ultimately may explain maintenance of health, recovery from injury, or development and progression of arthritis.},

It is argued that the controversial nature of these questions limits the ability to judge the validity of critical thinking testing. Following this discussion, the paper outlines a series of procedures that can help increase the validity of one fundamental aspect of critical thinking testing--multiple-choice testing of credibility judgment. The procedures rely on verbal reports of examinees' thinking on items to gain direct evidence on the reasons for their answer choices. It is recognized that multiple-choice tests cannot test all important aspects of critical thinking, but that improving multiple-choice tests where they are applicable can have important practical and scientific implications.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the viscoelastic shear properties of articular cartilage and to investigate the effects of the alteration of proteoglycan structure on these shear properties. Glycosidase treatments (chondroitinase ABC and Streptomyces hyaluronidase) were used to alter the proteoglycan structure and content of the tissue. The dynamic viscoelastic shear properties of control and treated tissues were measured and statistically compared. Specifically, cylindrical bovine cartilage specimens were subjected to oscillatory shear deformation of small amplitude (gamma degrees = 0.001 radian) over a physiological range of frequencies (0.01-20 Hz) and at various compressive strains (5, 9, 12, and 16%). The dynamic complex shear modulus was calculated from the measurements. The experimental results show that the solid matrix of normal articular cartilage exhibits intrinsic viscoelastic properties in shear over the range of frequencies tested. These viscoelastic shear properties were found to be dependent on compressive strains. Our data also provide significant insights into the structure-function relationships for articular cartilage. Significant correlations were found between the material properties (the magnitude of dynamic shear modulus, the phase shift angle, and the equilibrium compressive modulus), and the biochemical compositions of the cartilage (collagen, proteoglycan, and water contents). The shear modulus was greatly reduced when the proteoglycans were degraded by either chondroitinase ABC or Streptomyces hyaluronidase. The results suggest that the ability of collagen to resist tension elastically provides the stiffness of the cartilage matrix in shear and its elastic energy storage capability. Proteoglycans enmeshed in the collagen matrix inflate the collagen network and induce a tensile prestress in the collagen fibrils. This interaction of the collagen and proteoglycan within the cartilage matrix provides the complex mechanism that allows the tissue to resist shear deformation.},

abstract = {During monolayer culture, articular chondrocytes dedifferentiate into fibroblast-like cells. The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. We sought to further characterize dedifferentiation by identifying an extended panel of genes that distinguish articular cartilage from dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Thirty-nine candidate marker-genes were identified from previous studies on articular-cartilage gene-expression. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA levels for these candidates in calf articular cartilage and dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes. Twenty-two of the candidate marker genes exhibited at least a two-fold difference in gene expression in the two cell types. Twelve of these genes had at least a ten-fold difference in gene expression. Tenascin C (TNC), type I collagen (COL1A1), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1$\alpha$) showed the highest relative expression levels in dedifferentiated chonodrocytes. Type II collagen (COL2A1), type XI collagen (COL11A2), and superficial zone protein (SZP) showed the highest relative expression levels in articular cartilage. In contrast to previous findings, fibromodulin mRNA, and protein levels were higher in dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Compared to smaller subsets of markers, this panel of 12 highly differentially expressed genes may more precisely distinguish articular cartilage from dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Since many of the genes up-regulated in dedifferentiated chondrocytes are also expressed during cartilage development, dedifferentiated chondrocytes may possess features of cartilage precursor cells.},

abstract = {Previous work has established that mechanical forces can lead to quantifiable alterations in cell function. However, how forces change gene expression in a single cell and the mechanisms of force transmission to the nucleus are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the gene expression of proteins related to the extracellular matrix in single articular chondrocytes is modified by compressive forces in a dosage-dependent manner. Increasing force exposure catabolically shifts single-cell mRNA levels of aggrecan, collagen IIa, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. Cytohistochemistry reveals that the majority of strain experienced by the cell is also experienced by the nucleus, resulting in considerable changes in nuclear volume and structure. Transforming growth factor-beta1 and insulin-like growth factor-I offer mechanoprotection and recovery of gene expression of aggrecan and metalloproteinase-1. These results suggest that forces directly influence gene transcription and may do so by changing chromatin conformation.},

abstract = {Real-time PCR has become one of the most widely used methods of gene quantitation because it has a large dynamic range, boasts tremendous sensitivity, can be highly sequence-specific, has little to no post-amplification processing, and is amenable to increasing sample throughput. However, optimal benefit from these advantages requires a clear understanding of the many options available for running a real-time PCR experiment. Starting with the theory behind real-time PCR, this review discusses the key components of a real-time PCR experiment, including one-step or two-step PCR, absolute versus relative quantitation, mathematical models available for relative quantitation and amplification efficiency calculations, types of normalization or data correction, and detection chemistries. In addition, the many causes of variation as well as methods to calculate intra- and inter-assay variation are addressed.},

abstract = {Full-thickness articular cartilage defects rarely heal spontaneously. Some patients may not have clinically significant problems from chondral defects, but most eventually have degenerative changes. Techniques to treat chondral defects include abrasion, drilling, autografts, allografts, and cell transplantation. The senior author (JRS) developed the microfracture technique to enhance chondral resurfacing by providing a suitable environment for new tissue formation and taking advantage of the body's own healing potential. Microfracture has been done in more than 1800 patients. Specially designed awls are used to make multiple perforations, or microfractures, into the subchondral bone plate. Perforations are made as close together as possible, but not so close that one breaks into another. They usually are approximately 3 to 4 mm apart. The integrity of the subchondral bone plate must be maintained. The released marrow elements (including mesenchymal stem cells, growth factors, and other healing proteins) form a surgically induced super clot that provides an enriched environment for new tissue formation. The rehabilitation program is crucial to optimize the results of the surgery. It promotes the ideal physical environment for the marrow mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into articular cartilagelike cells, ultimately leading to development of a durable repair cartilage that fills the original defect.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To determine (1) if interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha), insulin like growth factor I (IGF-I), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) regulate proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) metabolism in articular cartilage, in terms of chondrocytes expressing PRG4 and PRG4 bound at the articular surface, and (2) if these features of cartilage PRG4 metabolism correlate with its secretion.

METHODS:Articular cartilage explants were harvested and cultured for 6 days with or without 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), alone, or with the addition of 10ng/ml IL-1alpha, 300ng/ml IGF-I, or 10ng/ml TGF-beta1. PRG4 expression by chondrocytes in the cartilage disks was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). PRG4 bound to the articular surface of disks was quantified by extraction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PRG4 secreted into culture medium was quantified by ELISA and characterized by Western Blot.

RESULTS:PRG4 expression by chondrocytes near the articular surface was markedly decreased by IL-1alpha, stimulated by TGF-beta1, and not affected by IGF-I. The level of PRG4 accumulation in the culture medium was correlated with the number of chondrocytes expressing PRG4. The amount of PRG4 bound at the articular surface was modulated by incubation in medium including FBS, but did not correlate with levels of PRG4 secretion.

CONCLUSIONS:Cartilage secretion of PRG4 is highly regulated by certain cytokines and growth factors, in part through alteration of the number of PRG4-secreting chondrocytes near the articular surface. The biochemical milieu may regulate the PRG4 content of synovial fluid during cartilage injury or repair.},

Its compressive and tensile properties are determined by its matrix and fluid composition, and are maintained by chondrocytes in the homeostatic joint. Osteoarthritis (OA) is increasingly understood as a family of disorders in which the biomechanical properties of cartilage are altered and ultimately fail as the tissue is degraded by local proteases. Mechanically mediated and cytokine-mediated pathways of cartilage degeneration have been identified in the pathogenesis of OA. Further insight into the basic science of cartilage and OA is necessary to develop diagnostic and treatment strategies for this pervasive disease.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that zonal populations of chondrocytes seeded into a bilayered scaffold with initially prescribed depth-varying, compressive material properties will lead to a biomimetic cartilage tissue construct with depth-dependent cellular and compressive mechanical inhomogeneity similar to that of the native tissue. Superficial zone chondrocytes (SZCs) and middle/deep zone chondrocytes (MDZCs) were isolated and encapsulated with 2% or 3% agarose to form single-layered constructs of 2% SZC, 3% SZC, 2% MDZC; bilayered constructs of 2% SZC/2% MDZC and 3% SZC/2% MDZC; and 2% mixed chondrocyte controls. For SZCs on day 42, increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen was found with increased agarose concentration and when layered with MDZCs. Superficial zone protein increased with agarose concentration in bilayered constructs. For MDZCs, increased GAG content and regulation of cell proliferation was observed when layered with SZCs. Bilayered constructs possessed a depth-dependent compressive modulus qualitatively similar to that of native articular cartilage, whereas controls showed a U-shaped profile with stiffer peripheral edges and softer middle region. This study is the first to create an engineered cartilage tissue with depth-varying cellular as well as mechanical inhomogeneity. Future studies will determine if replicating inhomogeneity is advantageous in clinical applications of tissue engineered cartilage.},

abstract = {The scientific, medical, and diagnostic communities have been presented the most powerful tool for quantitative nucleic acids analysis: real-time PCR [Bustin, S.A., 2004. A-Z of Quantitative PCR. IUL Press, San Diego, CA]. This new technique is a refinement of the original Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) developed by Kary Mullis and coworkers in the mid 80:ies [Saiki, R.K., et al., 1985. Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia, Science 230, 1350], for which Kary Mullis was awarded the 1993 year's Nobel prize in Chemistry. By PCR essentially any nucleic acid sequence present in a complex sample can be amplified in a cyclic process to generate a large number of identical copies that can readily be analyzed. This made it possible, for example, to manipulate DNA for cloning purposes, genetic engineering, and sequencing. But as an analytical technique the original PCR method had some serious limitations. By first amplifying the DNA sequence and then analyzing the product, quantification was exceedingly difficult since the PCR gave rise to essentially the same amount of product independently of the initial amount of DNA template molecules that were present. This limitation was resolved in 1992 by the development of real-time PCR by Higuchi et al. [Higuchi, R., Dollinger, G., Walsh, P.S., Griffith, R., 1992. Simultaneous amplification and detection of specific DNA-sequences. Bio-Technology 10(4), 413-417]. In real-time PCR the amount of product formed is monitored during the course of the reaction by monitoring the fluorescence of dyes or probes introduced into the reaction that is proportional to the amount of product formed, and the number of amplification cycles required to obtain a particular amount of DNA molecules is registered. Assuming a certain amplification efficiency, which typically is close to a doubling of the number of molecules per amplification cycle, it is possible to calculate the number of DNA molecules of the amplified sequence that were initially present in the sample. With the highly efficient detection chemistries, sensitive instrumentation, and optimized assays that are available today the number of DNA molecules of a particular sequence in a complex sample can be determined with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity sufficient to detect a single molecule. Typical uses of real-time PCR include pathogen detection, gene expression analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, analysis of chromosome aberrations, and most recently also protein detection by real-time immuno PCR.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Excessive mechanical loading of articular cartilage producing hydrostatic stress, tensile strain and fluid flow leads to irreversible cartilage erosion and osteoarthritic (OA) disease. Since application of high fluid shear to chondrocytes recapitulates some of the earmarks of OA, we aimed to screen the gene expression profiles of shear-activated chondrocytes and assess potential similarities with OA chondrocytes.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Using a cDNA microarray technology, we screened the differentially-regulated genes in human T/C-28a2 chondrocytes subjected to high fluid shear (20 dyn/cm(2)) for 48 h and 72 h relative to static controls. Confirmation of the expression patterns of select genes was obtained by qRT-PCR. Using significance analysis of microarrays with a 5% false discovery rate, 71 and 60 non-redundant transcripts were identified to be $\ge$2-fold up-regulated and $\le$0.6-fold down-regulated, respectively, in sheared chondrocytes. Published data sets indicate that 42 of these genes, which are related to extracellular matrix/degradation, cell proliferation/differentiation, inflammation and cell survival/death, are differentially-regulated in OA chondrocytes. In view of the pivotal role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the pathogenesis and/or progression of OA in vivo and regulation of shear-induced inflammation and apoptosis in vitro, we identified a collection of genes that are either up- or down-regulated by shear-induced COX-2. COX-2 and L-prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) induce reactive oxygen species production, and negatively regulate genes of the histone and cell cycle families, which may play a critical role in chondrocyte death.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Prolonged application of high fluid shear stress to chondrocytes recapitulates gene expression profiles associated with osteoarthritis. Our data suggest a potential link between exposure of chondrocytes/cartilage to abnormal mechanical loading and the pathogenesis/progression of OA.},

abstract = {The effects of extracellular and intracellular pH on matrix synthesis by isolated bovine chondrocytes were studied using radioisotope incorporation (35SO4 and 3H proline) and fluorescence techniques. Matrix synthesis exhibited a bimodal relation with decreased extracellular pH; with slight reductions (7.4 > pH > 7.1), synthesis increased (by up to 50%), whereas in more acidic media (pH < 7.1), synthesis was inhibited by up to 75% of control levels. The pHi was largely unchanged with extracellular acidity over the range producing stimulation of matrix synthesis but fell when exposed to the more acidic media shown to have an inhibitory action on matrix synthesis. The inhibition of matrix synthesis by lactic acid addition was unaffected by the lactic acid transporter alpha-CHC, suggesting H+ transport by this pathway is small. Direct imposition of a sustained intracellular acidosis (pHi = 6.65) using ammonium prepulse with amiloride inhibited matrix synthesis by about 20%. These results show that matrix synthesis by chondrocytes was affected by extracellular pH, an action which could not be entirely explained by changes to pHi.},

abstract = {Mechanical loading and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) influence the release of nitric oxide (*NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from articular chondrocytes via distinct signalling mechanisms. The exact nature of the interplay between the respective signalling pathways remains unclear. Recent studies have shown that integrins act as mechanoreceptors and may transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular signals, thereby influencing cellular response. The current study demonstrates that the application of dynamic compression induced an inhibition of *NO and an upregulation of cell proliferation and proteoglycan synthesis in the presence and absence of IL-1 beta. PGE2 release was not affected by dynamic compression in the absence of IL-1 beta but was inhibited in the presence of the cytokine. The integrin binding peptide, GRGDSP, abolished or reversed the compression-induced alterations in all four parameters assessed in the presence and absence of IL-1 beta. The non-binding control peptide, GRADSP, had no effect. These data clearly demonstrate that the metabolic response of the chondrocytes to dynamic compression in the presence and absence of IL-1 beta, are integrin mediated.},

This study investigated the effect of articular motion on the gene expression of superficial zone protein (SZP) and hyaluronan synthases (HASs) and on the release of SZP and hyaluronan of chondrocytes seeded onto biodegradable scaffolds. Cylindrical (8 x 4 mm) porous polyurethane scaffolds were seeded with bovine articular chondrocytes and subjected to static or dynamic compression, with and without articulation against a ceramic hip ball. After loading, the mRNA expression of SZP and HASs was analyzed, and SZP immunoreactivity and hyaluronan concentration of conditioned media were determined. Surface motion significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of SZP and HASs. Axial compression alone had no effect on SZP and increased HAS mRNA only at high strain amplitude. SZP was immunodetected only in the media of constructs exposed to surface motion. The release of hyaluronan into the culture medium was significantly enhanced by surface motion. These results indicate that specific stimuli that mimic the kinematics of natural joints, such as articular motion, may promote the development of a functional articular surface-synovial interface.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW:The prevalent nature of osteoarthritis, a cartilage degenerative disease that results in the erosion of joint surfaces and loss of mobility, underscores the importance of developing functional articular cartilage replacement. Recent research efforts have focused on tissue engineering as a promising approach for cartilage regeneration and repair. Tissue engineering is a multidisciplinary research area that incorporates both biological and engineering principles for the purpose of generating new, living tissues to replace the diseased/damaged tissue and restore tissue/organ function. This review surveys and highlights the current concepts and recent progress in cartilage tissue engineering, and discusses the challenges and potential of this rapidly advancing field of biomedical research.

RECENT FINDINGS:Cartilage tissue engineering is critically dependent on selection of appropriate cells (differentiated or progenitor cells); fabrication and utilization of biocompatible and mechanically suitable scaffolds for cell delivery; stimulation with chondrogenically bioactive molecules introduced in the form of recombinant proteins or via gene transfer; and application of dynamic, mechanical loading regimens for conditioning of the engineered tissue constructs, including the design of specialized biomechanically active bioreactors.

SUMMARY:Cell selection, scaffold design and biological stimulation remain the challenges of function tissue engineering. Successful regeneration or replacement of damaged or diseased cartilage will depend on future advances in our understanding of the biology of cartilage and stem cells and technological development in engineering.},

abstract = {In studies on a functionally isolated avian-bone preparation to which external loads could be applied in vivo, we determined the following information. Removal of load-bearing resulted in substantial remodeling endosteally, intracortically, and, to a lesser extent, periosteally. Since the balance of this remodeling was negative, bone mass declined. It therefore appears that functional load-bearing prevents a remodeling process that would otherwise lead to disuse osteoporosis. Four consecutive cycles a day of an externally applied loading regimen that engendered physiological strain magnitudes but an altered strain distribution prevented remodeling and was thus associated with no change in bone mass. A small exposure to, or the first effect of, a suitable dynamic strain regimen appears to be sufficient to prevent the negatively balanced remodeling that is responsible for disuse osteoporosis. Thirty-six 0.5-hertz cycles per day of the same load regimen also prevented intracortical resorption but was associated with substantial periosteal and endosteal new-bone formation. Over a six-week period, bone-mineral content increased to between 133 and 143 per cent of the original value. Physiological levels of strain imposed with an abnormal strain distribution can produce an osteogenic stimulus that is capable of increasing bone mass. Neither the size nor the character of the bone changes that we observed were affected by any additional increase in the number of load cycles from thirty-six to 1800. Clinical Relevance: The results of this experiment must be considered in relation to the type and duration of the non-physiological loads that were imposed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the effects of injurious compression on the biosynthesis of lubricin at different depths within articular cartilage and to examine alterations in structure and function of the articular surface following mechanical injury.

METHODS:Bovine cartilage explants were subdivided into level 1, with intact articular surface, and level 2, containing middle and deep zone cartilage. Following mechanical injury, lubricin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were monitored by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and soluble or cartilage-associated lubricin protein was analyzed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Cartilage morphology was assessed by histologic staining, and tissue functionality was assessed by friction testing.

RESULTS:Two days after injury, lubricin mRNA expression was up-regulated approximately 3-fold for level 1 explants and was down-regulated for level 2 explants. Lubricin expression in level 1 cartilage returned to control levels after 6 days in culture. Similarly, lubricin protein synthesis and secretion increased in response to injury for level 1 explants and decreased for level 2 cartilage. Histologic staining revealed changes in the articular surface of level 1 explants following injury, with respect to glycosaminoglycan and collagen content. Injured level 1 explants displayed an increased coefficient of friction relative to controls.

CONCLUSION:Our findings indicate that increased lubricin biosynthesis appears to be an early transient response of surface-layer cartilage to injurious compression. However, distinct morphologic changes occur with injury that appear to compromise the frictional properties of the tissue.},

abstract = {Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan in the articular cartilage. This molecule is important in the proper functioning of articular cartilage because it provides a hydrated gel structure (via its interaction with hyaluronan and link protein) that endows the cartilage with load-bearing properties. It is also crucial in chondroskeletal morphogenesis during development. Aggrecan is a multimodular molecule expressed by chondrocytes. Its core protein is composed of three globular domains (G1, G2, and G3) and a large extended region (CS) between G2 and G3 for glycosaminoglycan chain attachment. G1 comprises the amino terminus of the core protein. This domain has the same structural motif as link protein. Functionally, the G1 domain interacts with hyaluronan acid and link protein, forming stable ternary complexes in the extracellular matrix. G2 is homologous to the tandem repeats of G1 and of link protein and is involved in product processing. G3 makes up the carboxyl terminus of the core protein. It enhances glycosaminoglycan modification and product secretion.

abstract = {We report on the initial results of a web-based survey of 722 physics faculty in the United States regarding their instructional practices. The survey responses indicate that most faculty report knowing about many physics education research curricula and pedagogies and are interested and motivated to try them in their teaching. However, self-reports of actual classroom practices indicate that the availability of these curricula and pedagogies has not led to fundamental changes in instruction. Faculty report that time is the biggest impediment to implementing more research-based reforms. These results suggest a need for research-based dissemination that accounts for the complexity of instructional change.},

abstract = {Homeostasis of articular cartilage depends in part on mechanical loads generated during daily activity whereas inappropriate joint loads result in focal degeneration of cartilage, as occurs in osteoarthritis. We will review results of a series of questions regarding the effects of two types of mechanical loads-intermittent hydrostatic pressure and shear stress-on adult human articular chondrocytes in high-density monolayer culture. Intermittent hydrostatic pressure increased aggrecan and Type II collagen gene expression in normal chondrocytes and induced changes in the cell-associated proteins of normal and osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Hydrostatic pressure also counteracted inhibitory effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide on matrix protein expression by cultured chondrocytes. Application of shear stress to osteoarthritic chondrocytes increased the release of the proinflammatory mediator, nitric oxide, decreased aggrecan and Type II collagen expression, and induced molecular changes associated with apoptosis whereas hydrostatic pressure increased matrix macromolecule expression. The findings show that the types of load comprising the mechanical loading environment of articular cartilage considerably alter chondrocyte metabolism and suggest that mechanical stimulation may be used for in vitro or in vivo approaches for cartilage engineering.},

abstract = {The present studies were undertaken to evaluate the in vitro gel stability of the hydrogels alginate and agarose. Gel strength (of alginate and agarose) and protein diffusion (of alginate only) were shown to correlate with gel stability and to be useful techniques to monitor gel stability over time. The gel strengths of alginate and agarose were followed for a 90-day period using gel strength as a measure of gel stability. The gel strength of agarose diminished in the presence of cells because the cells likely interfered with the hydrogen bond formation required for agarose gelation. In the presence of cells, the gel strength of agarose decreased by an average of 25% from time 0 to 60 days, thereafter maintaining that value to 90 days. The gel strength of calcium- or barium-crosslinked alginate decreased over 90 days, with an equilibrium gel strength being achieved after 30 days. The presence of cells did not further decrease alginate gel strength. The gel strengths of calcium- and barium-crosslinked alginates were similar at 60 days-350 +/- 20 g and 300 +/- 60 g, respectively-indicating equivalence in their stability. The stability of calcium-crosslinked sodium alginate gels over a 60-day time period was monitored by diffusion of proteins ranging in molecular weight from 14.5 to 155 kD. From these diffusion measurements, the average pore size of the calcium-crosslinked alginate gels was estimated, using a semi-empirical model, to increase from approximately 176 to 289 A over a period of 60 days.

abstract = {Biotribology is the science of biological surfaces in sliding contact encompassing the concepts of friction, wear, and lubrication of interacting surfaces. This bioscience field has emerged from the classical field of tribology and is of paramount importance to the normal function of numerous tissues, including articular cartilage, blood vessels, heart, tendons, ligaments, and skin. Surprisingly, relatively little attention has been given to the restoration of surface characteristics in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine-the science of design and manufacture of new tissues for the functional restoration of impaired or diseased organs that depend on inductive signals, responding stem cells, and extracellular matrix scaffolding. Analogous to ancient civilizations (c. 3000 B.C.) that introduced wheeled vehicles, sledges for transporting heavy blocks, and lubricants, modern biotribologists must aim to restore surface characteristics to regenerated tissues and develop novel biomaterials with optimal tribological properties. The objective of this article is to highlight the significance of functional biotribology in the physiology of body surfaces and provide a comprehensive overview of unresolved issues and controversies as it relates to regenerative medicine. Specific attention is placed on the molecular basis of lubrication, mechanical and biochemical regulation of lubricating molecules, and the need to study wear processes in articular cartilage, especially in light of degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Surface engineering of replacement tissues exhibiting low friction and high wear resistance is examined using articular cartilage as an illustrative model system.},

abstract = {Fragments of calf articular cartilage maintained in organ culture were subjected to continuous mechanical pressure applied by means of lead weights of differing sizes. Increasing the pressure from approximately 7.5-30 kgfcm-2 proportionately decreased the breakdown of proteoglycans as measured by the release of [35S]sulphate from prelabeled cartilage. The difference was observed as early as 24 hours after culture. During the first 24 hours after removal of a 30 kgfcm-2 pressure the release of [35S]sulphate was slightly greater than that of the nonweight-bearing controls and then subsequently returned to the level of the controls. Application of a mechanical pressure of 30 kgfcm-2 to calf articular cartilage reduced the incorporation of [35S]sulphate to about half the level of the nonweight-bearing controls. A pressure of 15 kgfcm-2 had no significant effect upon [35S]sulphate incorporation. The production of lactate by the cartilage under the influence of 30 kgfcm-2 for 4 days was not significantly different from that of nonweight-bearing controls indicating the retained viability of the tissue. The present study indicates that proteoglycan metabolism of calf articular cartilage in vitro is capable of responding rapidly to variations in applied load. The potential importance of this finding in terms of the functional demands of articular cartilage is apparent, and it can be speculated that a failure of this adaptability of the chondrocytes is an important factor in the etiology of degenerative joint disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To test if subpopulations of chondrocytes from different cartilage zones could be used to engineer cartilage constructs with features of normal stratification. ESIGN: Chondrocytes from the superficial and middle zones of immature bovine cartilage were cultured in alginate, released, and seeded either separately or sequentially to form cartilage constructs. Constructs were cultured for 1 or 2 weeks and were assessed for growth, compressive properties, and deposition, and localization of matrix molecules and superficial zone protein (SZP).

RESULTS:The cartilaginous constructs formed from superficial zone chondrocytes exhibited less matrix growth and lower compressive properties than constructs from middle zone chondrocytes, with the stratified superficial-middle constructs exhibiting intermediate properties. Expression of SZP was highest at the construct surfaces, with the localization of SZP in superficial-middle constructs being concentrated at the superficial surface.

CONCLUSIONS:Manipulation of subpopulations of chondrocytes can be useful in engineering cartilage tissue with a biomimetic approach, and in fabricating constructs that exhibit stratified features of normal articular cartilage.},

abstract = {Due to the prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) and damage to articular cartilage, coupled with the poor intrinsic healing capacity of this avascular connective tissue, there is a great demand for an articular cartilage substitute. As the bearing material of diarthrodial joints, articular cartilage has remarkable functional properties that have been difficult to reproduce in tissue-engineered constructs. We have previously demonstrated that by using a functional tissue engineering approach that incorporates mechanical loading into the long-term culture environment, one can enhance the development of mechanical properties in chondrocyte-seeded agarose constructs. As these gel constructs begin to achieve material properties similar to that of the native tissue, however, new challenges arise, including integration of the construct with the underlying native bone. To address this issue, we have developed a technique for producing gel constructs integrated into an underlying bony substrate. These osteochondral constructs develop cartilage-like extracellular matrix and material properties over time in free swelling culture. In this study, as a preliminary to loading such osteochondral constructs, finite element modeling (FEM) was used to predict the spatial and temporal stress, strain, and fluid flow fields within constructs subjected to dynamic deformational loading. The results of these models suggest that while chondral ("gel alone") constructs see a largely homogenous field of mechanical signals, osteochondral ("gel bone") constructs see a largely inhomogeneous distribution of mechanical signals. Such inhomogeneity in the mechanical environment may aid in the development of inhomogeneity in the engineered osteochondral constructs. Together with experimental observations, we anticipate that such modeling efforts will provide direction for our efforts aimed at the optimization of applied physical forces for the functional tissue engineering of an osteochondral articular cartilage substitute.},

This PG is synthesized and secreted selectively by chondrocytes of this zone but has not been demonstrated in culture medium from slices deeper in the same tissue. There is little, if any, incorporation of this PG into the extracellular matrix. The PG has been partially purified by isopycnic CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE Sephacel, and gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B. It migrates by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 345 kDa. The molecule is degraded by papain, trypsin, or pronase; however, limited pepsin treatment performed at 4 degrees C only decreases its molecular weight to approximately 315 kDa. The molecule is substituted with keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, which are largely removed by limited pepsin treatment. In addition, this PG, or a very similar molecule, has been demonstrated in synovial fluid. This novel PG may serve as a functional metabolic marker for chondrocytes of the superficial zone of articular cartilage.},

The biochemical composition of tissue engineered cartilage constructs were altered by varying either (i) the initial cell seeding density of the scaffold (seeding density protocol) or (ii) the length of time the engineered tissue was cultured (culture period protocol). The aggregate or Young's moduli of the constructs were measured (by confined or unconfined compression respectively), and compared with the composition of the extracellular matrix by quantitative measurement of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG), hydroxyproline, collagen I and collagen II and collagen cross-links. The aggregate modulus correlated positively with both GAG and collagen II content, but not with collagen I content. Young's modulus correlated positively with GAG, collagen II and collagen I content, and the ratio of mature to immature cross-links. There was no significant correlation of Young's Modulus with total collagen measured as hydroxyproline content. These results suggested that hydroxyproline determination may be an unreliable indicator of mechanical quality of tissue engineered cartilage, and that a measure of collagen II and GAG content is required to predict the biomechanical quality of tissue engineered cartilage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Despite the popularity of microfracture as a first-line treatment for articular cartilage defects in the knee, systematic information on its clinical efficacy for articular cartilage repair and long-term improvement of knee function is not available.

HYPOTHESIS:Systematic analysis of the existing clinical literature of microfracture in the knee can improve the understanding of the advantages and limitations of this cartilage repair technique and can help to optimize its indications and clinical outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN:Systematic review.

METHODS:A comprehensive literature search was performed using established search engines (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify original human studies of articular cartilage repair with microfracture. Modified Coleman Methodology Scores were used to analyze the quality of the existing studies. Clinical efficacy of articular cartilage repair was evaluated by systematic analysis of short- and long-term functional outcome scores, macroscopic and microscopic repair cartilage quality, and findings of postoperative magnetic resonance imaging.

RESULTS:Twenty-eight studies describing 3122 patients were included in the review. The average follow-up was 41 months, with only 5 studies reporting follow-up of 5 years or more. Six studies were randomized controlled trials and the mean Coleman Methodology Score was 58 (range, 22-97). Microfracture effectively improved knee function in all studies during the first 24 months after microfracture, but the reports on durability of the initial functional improvement were conflicting. Several factors were identified that affected clinical outcome. Defect fill on magnetic resonance imaging was highly variable and correlated with functional outcome. Macroscopic repair cartilage quality positively affected long-term failure rate, while the influence of histologic repair tissue quality remained inconclusive.

CONCLUSION:This systematic analysis shows that microfracture provides effective short-term functional improvement of knee function but insufficient data are available on its long-term results. Shortcomings of the technique include limited hyaline repair tissue, variable repair cartilage volume, and possible functional deterioration. The quality of the currently available data on micro-fracture is still limited by the variability of results and study designs. Further well-designed studies are needed to determine the long-term efficacy of microfracture and to define its specific clinical indications compared to other cartilage repair techniques.},

Critical thinking appears to be a very attractive example of such a skill but this article argues against the idea that critical thinking is a core skill that should be widely taught to bridge what is termed {\textquoteleft}the academic vocational divide{\textquoteright}. Some of the attractions of this idea are acknowledged but it is argued that the very meanings of critical, academic and vocational depend upon the context and purpose of thinking and it is misleading to suggest that thinking is any kind of a skill. On the basis of this argument and an empirical study it is concluded that when the idea informs curricular policy and practice, far from bridging an academic vocational divide, the idea will actually widen it. If this conclusion is correct for what appears to be a most plausible candidate for a core or key skill, then policies designed to bridge an academic vocational divide that are b...},

abstract = {Perception of mechanical signals and the biological responses to such stimuli are fundamental properties of load bearing articular cartilage in diarthrodial joints. Chondrocytes utilize mechanical signals to synthesize an extracellular matrix capable of withstanding high loads and shear stresses. Recent studies have shown that chondrocytes undergo changes in shape and volume in a coordinated manner with load induced deformation of the matrix. These matrix changes, together with alterations in hydrostatic pressure, ionic and osmotic composition, interstitial fluid and streaming potentials are, in turn, perceived by chondrocytes. Chondrocyte responses to these stimuli are specific and well coordinated to bring about changes in gene expression, protein synthesis, matrix composition and ultimately biomechanical competence. In this hypothesis paper we propose a chondrocyte mechanoreceptor model incorporating key extracellular matrix macromolecules, integrins, mechanosensitive ion channels, the cytoskeleton and subcellular signal transduction pathways that maintain the chondrocyte phenotype, prevent chondrocyte apoptosis and regulate chondrocyte-specific gene expression.},

abstract = {Recent studies have reported that certain regimes of compressive loading of articular cartilage result in increased cell death in the superficial tangential zone (STZ). The objectives of this study were (1) to test the prevalent hypothesis that preferential cell death in the STZ results from excessive compressive strain in that zone, relative to the middle and deep zones, by determining whether cell death correlates with the magnitude of compressive strain and (2) to test the corollary hypothesis that the viability response of cells is uniform through the thickness of the articular layer when exposed to the same loading environment. Live cartilage explants were statically compressed by approximately 65% of their original thickness, either normal to the articular surface (axial loading) or parallel to it (transverse loading). Cell viability after 12 h was compared to the local strain distribution measured by digital image correlation. Results showed that the strain distribution in the axially loaded samples was highest in the STZ (77%) and lowest in the deep zone (55%), whereas the strain was uniformly distributed in the transversely loaded samples (64%). In contrast, axially and transversely loaded samples exhibited very similar profiles of cell death through the depth, with a preferential distribution in the STZ. Unloaded control samples showed negligible cell death. Thus, under prolonged static loading, depth-dependent variations in chondrocyte death did not correlate with the local depth-dependent compressive strain, and the prevalent hypothesis must be rejected. An alternative hypothesis, suggested by these results, is that superficial zone chondrocytes are more vulnerable to prolonged static loading than chondrocytes in the middle and deep zones.},

This article presents a critical review and assessment of how TEL is interpreted in recent literature. It examines the purpose of technology interventions, the approaches adopted to demonstrate the role of technology in enhancing the learning experience, differing ways in which enhancement is conceived and the use of various forms evidence to substantiate claims about TEL. Thematic analysis enabled categories to be developed and relationships explored between the aims of TEL interventions, the evidence presented, and the ways in which enhancement is conceived.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to examine the simultaneous effects of mechanical compression of chondrocytes on mRNA expression and macromolecular synthesis of aggrecan and type-II collagen. Bovine cartilage explants were exposed to different magnitudes and durations of applied mechanical compression, and levels of aggrecan and type-IIa collagen mRNA normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were measured and quantified by Northern blot analysis. Synthesis of aggrecan and type-II collagen protein was measured by radiolabel incorporation of [35S]sulfate and [3H]proline into macromolecules. The results showed a dose-dependent decrease in mRNA levels for aggrecan and type-II collagen, with increasing compression relative to physiological cut thickness applied for 24 hours. Radiolabel incorporation into glycosaminoglycans and collagen also decreased with increasing compression in a dose-related manner similar to the changes seen in mRNA expression. The modulation of aggrecan and type-II collagen mRNA and protein synthesis were dependent on the duration of the compression. Aggrecan and type-II collagen mRNA expression increased during the initial 0.5 hours of static compression; however, 4-24 hours after compression was applied total mRNA levels had significantly decreased. The synthesis of aggrecan and collagen protein decreased more rapidly than did mRNA levels after the application of a step compression. Together, these results suggest that mechanical compression rapidly alters chondrocyte aggrecan and type-II collagen gene expression on application of load. However, our results indicate that the observed decreases in biosynthesis may not be related solely to changes in mRNA expression. The mechanisms by which mechanical forces affect different segments of the biosynthetic pathways remain to be determined.},

We have previously demonstrated that primary monolayer cultures of human chondrocytes have an electrophysiological response after intermittent pressure-induced strain characterised by a membrane hyperpolarisation of approximately 40%. The mechanisms responsible for these changes are not fully understood but potentially involve signalling molecules such as integrins that link extracellular matrix with cytoplasmic components. The results reported in this paper demonstrate that the transduction pathways involved in the hyperpolarisation response of human articular chondrocytes in vitro after cyclical pressure-induced strain involve alpha 5 beta 1 integrin. We have demonstrated, using pharmacological inhibitors of a variety of intracellular signalling pathways, that the actin cytoskeleton, the phospholipase C calmodulin pathway, and both tyrosine protein kinase and protein kinase C activities are important in the transduction of the electrophysiological response. These results suggest that alpha 5 beta 1 is an important chondrocyte mechanoreceptor and a potential regulator of chondrocyte function.},

abstract = {Chondrocytes in specific areas of the chick sternum have different developmental fates. Cephalic chondrocytes become hypertrophic and secrete type X collagen into the extracellular matrix prior to bone deposition. Middle and caudal chondrocytes remain cartilaginous throughout development and continue to secrete collagen types II, IX, and XI. The interaction of integrin receptors with extracellular matrix molecules has been shown to affect cytoskeleton organization, proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression in other cell types. We hypothesized that chondrocyte survival and differentiation including the deposition into interstitial matrix of type X collagen may be integrin receptor mediated. To test this hypothesis, a serum-free organ culture sternal model that recapitulates normal development and maintains the three-dimensional relationships of the tissue was developed. We examined chondrocyte differentiation by five parameters: type X collagen deposition into interstitial matrix, sternal growth, actin distribution, cell shape, and cell diameter changes. Additional sterna were analyzed for apoptosis using a fragmented DNA assay. Sterna were organ cultured with blocking antibodies specific for integrin subunits (alpha2, alpha3, or beta1). In the presence of anti-beta1 integrin (25 microg/ml, clone W1B10), type X collagen deposition into interstitial matrix and sternal growth were significantly inhibited. In addition, all chondrocytes were significantly smaller, the actin was disrupted, and there was a significant increase in apoptosis throughout the specimens. Addition of anti-alpha2 (10 microg/ml, clone P1E6) or anti-alpha3 (10 microg/ml, clone P1B5) integrin partially inhibited type X collagen deposition into interstitial matrix; however, sternal growth and cell size were significantly decreased. These data are the first obtained from intact tissue and demonstrate that the interaction of chondrocytes with extracellular matrix is required for chondrocyte survival and differentiation.},

abstract = {Chondrocytes are influenced by mechanical forces to remodel cartilage extracellular matrix. Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of mechanical forces on changes in biosynthesis and mRNA levels of particular extracellular matrix molecules, and have identified certain signaling pathways that may be involved. However, the broad extent and kinetics of mechano-regulation of gene transcription has not been studied in depth. We applied static compressive strains to bovine cartilage explants for periods between 1 and 24 h and measured the response of 28 genes using real time PCR. Compression time courses were also performed in the presence of an intracellular calcium chelator or an inhibitor of cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase A. Cluster analysis of the data revealed four main expression patterns: two groups containing either transiently up-regulated or duration-enhanced expression profiles could each be subdivided into genes that did or did not require intracellular calcium release and cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase A for their mechano-regulation. Transcription levels for aggrecan, type II collagen, and link protein were up-regulated approximately 2-3-fold during the first 8 h of 50% compression and subsequently down-regulated to levels below that of free-swelling controls by 24 h. Transcription levels of matrix metalloproteinases-3, -9, and -13, aggrecanase-1, and the matrix protease regulator cyclooxygenase-2 increased with the duration of 50% compression 2-16-fold by 24 h. Thus, transcription of proteins involved in matrix remodeling and catabolism dominated over anabolic matrix proteins as the duration of static compression increased. Immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun were dramatically up-regulated 6-30-fold, respectively, during the first 8 h of 50% compression and remained up-regulated after 24 h.},

abstract = {The collagen framework of hyaline cartilages, including articular cartilage, consists largely of type II collagen that matures from a cross-linked heteropolymeric fibril template of types II, IX, and XI collagens. In the articular cartilages of adult joints, type III collagen makes an appearance in varying amounts superimposed on the original collagen fibril network. In a study to understand better the structural role of type III collagen in cartilage, we find that type III collagen molecules with unprocessed N-propeptides are present in the extracellular matrix of adult human and bovine articular cartilages as covalently cross-linked polymers extensively cross-linked to type II collagen. Cross-link analyses revealed that telopeptides from both N and C termini of type III collagen were linked in the tissue to helical cross-linking sites in type II collagen. Reciprocally, telopeptides from type II collagen were recovered cross-linked to helical sites in type III collagen. Cross-linked peptides were also identified in which a trifunctional pyridinoline linked both an alpha1(II) and an alpha1(III) telopeptide to the alpha1(III) helix. This can only have arisen from a cross-link between three different collagen molecules, types II and III in register staggered by 4D from another type III molecule. Type III collagen is known to be prominent at sites of healing and repair in skin and other tissues. The present findings emphasize the role of type III collagen, which is synthesized in mature articular cartilage, as a covalent modifier that may add cohesion to a weakened, existing collagen type II fibril network as part of a chondrocyte healing response to matrix damage.},

abstract = {Chondrocytes comprise less than 10% of cartilage tissue but are responsible for sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli imposed on the joint. However, the effect of mechanical signals at the cellular level is not yet fully defined. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mechanical stimulation in the form of cyclic strain modulates proliferative capacity and integrin expression of chondrocytes from osteoarthritic knee joints. Chondrocytes isolated from articular cartilage during total knee arthroplasty were propagated on flexible silicone membranes. The cells were subjected to cyclic strain for 24 h using a computer-controlled vacuum device, with replicate samples maintained under static conditions. Our results demonstrated increase in proliferative capacity of the cells subjected to cyclic strain compared with cells maintained under static conditions. The flexed cells also exhibited upregulation of the chondrocytic gene markers type II collagen and aggrecan. In addition, cyclic strain resulted in increased expression of the alpha2 and alpha5 integrin subunits, as well as an increased expression of vimentin. There was also intracellular reconfiguration of the enzyme protein kinase C. Our findings suggest that these molecules may play a role in the signal transduction pathway, eliciting cellular response to mechanical stimulation.},

abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that selective and specific capacitively coupled electrical signals could stimulate gene expression and matrix production in bovine articular chondrocytes. Starting with a capacitively coupled electric signal that previously was shown to be effective in stimulating proliferation in bovine articular cartilage chondrocytes, dose responses were done sequentially for duration, response time, amplitude, duty cycle, and frequency. Results showed that a 0.5-hour, 20 mV/cm, signal at 60 kHz up-regulated aggrecan gene expression approximately eightfold (p < 0.0003) using a 50% duty cycle, whereas Type II collagen gene expression was up-regulated approximately fivefold (p < 0.02) using an 8.3% duty cycle. Using a compound signal (a 0.5-hour continuous period plus multiple 1-hour periods of 50% duty cycle for 7 days) both proteoglycan and collagen accumulation in vitro were increased approximately fivefold (p < 0.0003) and twofold (p < 0.0008), respectively. Also, the most effective capacitively coupled electric signal was different for each of the two molecules studied (aggrecan, 50% duty cycle and 4-hour response time; Type II collagen, 8.3% duty cycle and 6-hour response time). We conclude that selective up-regulation of gene expression and matrix accumulation of cartilage structural macromolecules (such as aggrecan and Type II collagen) with specific capacitively coupled fields occurs in vitro. This may be useful in vivo as a noninvasive modality to promote cartilage healing or ameliorate the effects of osteoarthritis, or both.},

abstract = {Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by pain and disability. It involves all ages and 70% of people aged >65 have some degree of osteoarthritis. Natural cartilage repair is limited because chondrocyte density and metabolism are low and cartilage has no blood supply. The results of joint-preserving treatment protocols such as debridement, mosaicplasty, perichondrium transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation vary largely and the average long-term result is unsatisfactory. One reason for limited clinical success is that most treatments require new cartilage to be formed at the site of a defect. However, the mechanical conditions at such sites are unfavorable for repair of the original damaged cartilage. Therefore, it is unlikely that healthy cartilage would form at these locations. The most promising method to circumvent this problem is to engineer mechanically stable cartilage ex vivo and to implant that into the damaged tissue area. This review outlines the issues related to the composition and functionality of tissue-engineered cartilage. In particular, the focus will be on the parameters cell source, signaling molecules, scaffolds and mechanical stimulation. In addition, the current status of tissue engineering of cartilage will be discussed, with the focus on extracellular matrix content, structure and its functionality.},

abstract = {When a major change initiative runs aground, leaders often blame their company's culture for pushing it off course. They try to forge ahead by overhauling the culture--a tactic that tends to fizzle, fail, or backfire. Most cultures are too well entrenched to be jettisoned. The secret is to stop fighting your culture--and to work with and within it, until it evolves in the right direction. Today's best-performing companies, such as Southwest Airlines, Apple, and the Four Seasons, understand this, say the authors, three consultants from Booz {\&} Company. These organizations follow five principles for making the most of their cultures: 1. Match strategy to culture. Culture trumps strategy every time, no matter how brilliant the plan, so the two need to be in alignment. 2. Focus on a few critical shifts in behavior. Wholesale change is hard; choose your battles wisely. 3. Honor the strengths of the existing culture. Every culture is the product of good intentions and has strengths; put them to use. 4. Integrate formal and informal interventions. Don't just implement new rules and processes; identify "influencers" who can bring other employees along. 5. Measure and monitor cultural evolution. Otherwise you can't identify backsliding or correct course. When the leaders of Aetna applied these rules while implementing a new strategy in the early 2000s, they reinvigorated the company's ailing culture and restored employee pride. That shift was reflected in the business results, as Aetna went from a $300 million loss to a $1.7 billion gain.},

On the level of theory development, the book clarifies the nature of an emerging "models and modeling perspective" about teaching, learning, and problem solving in mathematics and science education. On the level of emphasizing practical problems, it clarifies the nature of some of the most important elementary-but-powerful mathematical or scientific understandings and abilities that Americans are likely to need as foundations for success in the present and future technology-based information age. Beyond Constructivism: Models and Modeling Perspectives on Mathematics Problem Solving, Learning, and Teaching features an innovative Web site housing online appendices for each chapter, designed to supplement the print chapters with digital resources that include example problems, relevant research tools and video clips, as well as transcripts and other samples of students' work: http://tcct.soe.purdue.edu/booksULandULjournals/modelsULandUL modeling/ This is an essential volume for graduate-level courses in mathematics and science education, cognition and learning, and critical and creative thinking, as well as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in these areas.},

abstract = {The focus of this review is on conceptual and functional advances in our understanding of the small leucine-rich proteoglycans. These molecules belong to an expanding gene class whose distinctive feature is a structural motif, called the leucine-rich repeat, found in an increasing number of intracellular and extracellular proteins with diverse biological attributes. Three-dimensional modeling of their prototype protein core proposes a flexible, arch-shaped binding surface suitable for strong and distinctive interactions with ligand proteins. Changes in the properties of individual proteoglycans derive from amino acid substitutions in the less conserved surface residues, changes in the number and length of the leucine-rich repeats, and/or variation in glycosylation. These proteoglycans are tissue organizers, orienting and ordering collagen fibrils during ontogeny and in pathological processes such as wound healing, tissue repair, and tumor stroma formation. These properties are rooted in their bifunctional character: the protein moiety binding collagen fibrils at strategic loci, the microscopic gaps between staggered fibrils, and the highly charged glycosaminoglycans extending out to regulate interfibrillar distances and thereby establishing the exact topology of fibrillar collagens in tissues. These proteoglycans also interact with soluble growth factors, modulate their functional activity, and bind to cell surface receptors. The latter interaction affects cell cycle progression in a variety of cellular systems and could explain the purported changes in the expression of these gene products around the invasive neoplastic cells and in regenerating tissues.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To compare two fluorometric assays, utilizing (1) the bisbenzimidazole Hoechst 33258 and (2) PicoGreen, for determining DNA content in human cartilage.

METHODS:Human articular and nasal septal cartilage explants were digested using proteinase K. Portions of sample digest were analysed for intrinsic and dye-enhanced fluorescence with either Hoechst 33258 or PicoGreen.

RESULTS:Intrinsic tissue fluorescence in both articular and septal cartilage increased with age and was prominent at wavelengths used for Hoechst 33258 but relatively low at wavelengths used for PicoGreen. The relative contribution of intrinsic fluorescence to total dye-enhanced fluorescence of human cartilage was markedly greater for Hoechst 33258 (19-57%) than for PicoGreen (2-7%). Thus, in many situations, DNA in human cartilage can be assayed using PicoGreen without the need to correct for intrinsic cartilage fluorescence. The enhancement of fluorescence by each dye was found to be specific for DNA, as shown by fluorescence spectra, >90% sensitivity to DNase, and resistance to RNase. In addition, little or no interference was caused by non-DNA tissue components, since DNA caused an equal enhancement in the absence or presence of proteinase K digested human cartilage, once intrinsic cartilage fluorescence was subtracted. PicoGreen was more sensitive for assaying DNA (0.9ng DNA/ml) than Hoechst 33258 (6ng DNA/ml) and can also be used in a microplate reader.

CONCLUSION:PicoGreen can be used in a rapid and sensitive assay to quantify DNA in small samples of human cartilage.},

abstract = {A four-level rubric based on Bloom's learning taxonomy was created in 2005 to evaluate student responses to co-curricular activities and determine if the activities' career awareness and lifelong learning objectives were achieved. Students were not provided with specific guidelines for the written summaries. Holistic evaluation of summaries by three independent researchers showed that co-curricular activities can be effective in enhancing a first-year student's appreciation for lifelong learning as a key part of a professional engineer's career. Also in 2005, the three researchers identified key words/phrases associated with each of the four levels of the rubric, and there was generally strong agreement among the researchers in using the rubric in scoring the written summaries. This paper reports quantitative and qualitative results of further investigation on the inter- rater reliability of the evaluation rubric, and whether providing students with a guideline for the written summaries influences their performance. For this expanded research, a total of six evaluators and two groups of 32 students were involved. Results of chi-square tests for the differences between the two groups of evaluators and the two groups of student summaries are presented. This research will expand perception of how Bloom's learning taxonomy could be used in lifelong learning assessment, and should be of value to anyone interested in assessing lifelong learning.

The comparison took place in a computer-supported collaborative learning context. The results reported here demonstrated that access to a teacher or a large group of same-aged peers were equally potent learning resources in computer supported collaborative learning environments. Analyses further confirmed that students working in groups and students individually tutored by a teacher learned and achieved more on a battery of tests than children who worked with only one other child partner. These results differ substantially from a large body of research reported to date (Bloom, 1984; Hughes {\&} Greenhough, 1995; Radziszewska {\&} Rogoff, 1991; Rogoff, 1990).},

abstract = {Cell-based regenerative medicine, including tissue engineering, is a novel approach to reconstituting tissues that do not spontaneously heal, such as damaged cartilage, and to curing diseases caused by malfunctioning cells. Typically, manufacturing processes to generate cartilage for replacement therapies involve isolation and expansion of cells from cartilage biopsies. A challenge in the field is potential contamination by other cell types (e.g., fibroblast-like cells), which can overgrow the desired cells during culturing and may ultimately compromise clinical efficacy. No standard analytical system has been absolutely effective in ensuring the identity of these cell-based products. Therefore, we tested deoxyribonucleic acid methylation analysis as a quality assessment tool, applying it to Genzyme's Carticel product, a chondrocyte implant that the Food and Drug Administration has approved. We identified 7 potent discriminators by assaying candidate genomic regions derived from methylation discovery approaches and literature searches regarding a functional role of genes in chondrocyte biology. Using a support vector machine, we trained an optimal cell type classifier that was absolutely effective in discriminating chondrocytes from synovial membrane derived cells, the major potential contaminant of chondrocyte cultures. The abundant marker availability and high quality of this assay format also suggest it as a potential quality control test for other cell types grown or manipulated in vitro.},

abstract = {Chondrocytes, the cellular component of the articular cartilage, have long been recognized as strain-sensitive cells, and have the ability to sense mechanical stimulation through surface receptors and intracellular signaling pathways. This strain-induced biological response of chondrocytes has been exploited to facilitate chondrocyte culture in in vitro systems; examples include the application of hydrostatic pressure, dynamic compression, hydrodynamic shear (i.e., rotating bioreactors), and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (US). While the ability of US to influence chondrogenesis has been documented, the precise mechanisms of US-induced stimulation continue to be investigated. There remains a critical need to evaluate the impact of US on chondrocytes in 3D culture, which is a necessary microenvironment for maintaining the chondrocyte phenotype. In this study, a continuous US wave for predetermined time intervals was employed, as opposed to pulsed US used in previous studies, to stimulate chondrocytes seeded in 3D scaffolds. The chondrocytes (n = 6) were subjected to US stimulation as follows: 1.5 MHz for 161 seconds, 5.0 MHz for 51 seconds, and 8.5 MHz for 24 seconds, and the US signal was applied twice in a 24-hour period. Scaffolds that are not stimulated by US served as the control. Both the control and the US-stimulated groups were maintained in culture for 10 days, and at the conclusion of the culture period, chondrocytes were assayed for total DNA content, morphology, and cartilage-specific gene expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Our results show that chondrocytes when stimulated with continuous US for predetermined time intervals possessed higher cellular viability (1.2 to 1.4 times) and higher levels of type II collagen and aggrecan mRNA expression when compared to controls.},

abstract = {To gain insight regarding the rate at which cartilage tissue can sense and respond to a dynamic mechanical stimulus, we have examined the time-course of changes in biosynthetic activity following both the application and release of a static compressive stress. Cartilage harvested from the reserve zone of calf epiphyseal plate was subjected to unconfined static compressive stresses of 0, 0.25 and 0.5 MPa. Incorporation of [35S]sulfate and [3H]proline was measured during loading periods of less than 1 to 26 h and after preloading periods of 0.5, 2 or 12 h. During loading, total incorporation decreased to steady levels with time constants estimated to be 0.25-4 h (proline) and 1-5 h (sulfate). Proline incorporation exceeded control levels for 3 h after release of a 2 or 12 h preload. Sulfate incorporation remained depressed for at least 4 h after release of a 12 h preload and remained at control levels following release of 0.5 and 2 h preloads. We conclude that the modulation of proline incorporation by both loading and load release is faster than the modulation of sulfate incorporation. Furthermore, the response to unloading is not just the inverse of the response to loading; this nonlinearity suggests that the response to dynamic loading would not be determined simply by the time average component of the dynamic load.},

Various forms of mechanical stimuli accompany articular cartilage development in vivo, and one of these is hydrostatic pressure. This study used histology, biochemistry, and biomechanics to examine the effects of intermittent hydrostatic pressure, applied at 10 MPa and 1 Hz for 4 h per day for 5 days per week for up to 8 weeks on self-assembled chondrocyte constructs. The self-assembling process is a novel approach that allows engineering of articular cartilage constructs without the use of exogenous scaffolds. The self-assembled constructs were found to be capable of enduring this loading regimen. Significant increases in collagen production were only observed in pressurized samples. Intermittent hydrostatic pressure prevented a significant decrease in total GAG, which was significant in controls. Aside from the beneficial effects intermittent hydrostatic pressur...},

abstract = {The study was designed to determine the contents and distributions of the proteoglycans decorin and biglycan in adult human femoral condylar cartilage and whether these may change in osteoarthritis. New radioimmunoassays were established using peptides representing the amino-terminal 21 amino acid sequence of each proteoglycan (to which a tyrosine was added for radioiodination) and antibodies in a rabbit antiserum raised to both these molecules. Cartilage was extracted with 4 M guanidine HCl to determine total content, and extracts were analyzed by chromatography to determine molecular sizes. Frozen sections were cut parallel to the articular surface and were extracted to determine distribution within the tissue. Gel chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B under dissociative conditions revealed molecules with a partition coefficient of 0.7-0.75 in both normal and osteoarthritic cartilage. In normal adult cartilage, the mean contents of the core proteins of biglycan and decorin were calculated to be approximately 0.34 and 0.48 mg per gram wet weight, respectively. These represented molar contents similar to that of aggrecan. In osteoarthritic cartilage, there were no overall significant changes in the content and distribution of these molecules. There was, however, considerable individual variation in both distribution and content. Analyses indicated that there was a trend in osteoarthritic cartilage toward a loss of biglycan and decorin from the more superficial layers of intact cartilage, where both these molecules are normally more concentrated. This was accompanied by maintenance of proteoglycan content deeper in the cartilage, regardless of the degree of degeneration.},

This paper considers factors (at institutional, departmental and individual levels) that bear on the satisfaction of these conditions, and how they interrelate.

abstract = {The management of articular cartilage defects remains challenging and controversial. Hyaline cartilage has limited capacity for self-repair and post-injury cartilage is predominantly replaced by fibrocartilage through healing from the subchondral bone. Fibrocartilage lacks the key properties that characterize hyaline cartilage such as capacity for compression, hydrodynamic permeability and smoothness of the articular surface. Many reports relate compromised function associated with repaired cartilage and loss of function of the articular surface. Novel methods have been proposed with the key aim to regenerate hyaline cartilage for repair of osteochondral defects. Over the past decade, with many exciting developments in tissue engineering and regenerative cell-based technologies, we are now able to consider new combinatorial approaches to overcome the problems associated with osteochondral injuries and damage. In this review, the currently accepted surgical approaches are reviewed and considered; debridement, marrow stimulation, whole tissue transplantation and cellular repair. More recent products, which employ tissue engineering approaches to enhance the traditional methods of repair, are discussed. Future trends must not only focus on recreating the composition of articular cartilage, but more importantly recapitulate the nano-structure of articular cartilage to improve the functional strength and integration of repair tissue.},

Boundary lubrication was measured in vitro in an arthrotripsometer oscillating natural latex against polished glass under a load of 0.35 MPa with an entraining velocity of 0.37 mm/s. The two hyaluronate solutions possessed the same hyaluronate concentration as synovial fluid, but Healon was 4.5 times more viscous. Present practice of viscosupplementation therapy for degenerative joint disease is limited and fails to implicate the important role of synovial mucin. Boundary lubrication provided by synovial mucin, independent of its viscosity, is not replicated by hyaluronate hydrogels.},

This provides a challenging agenda for the development of subject-based teaching. Implementing this agenda includes applying the principles of good practice in the disciplines; developing the status of teaching; developing the complementary nature of teaching and research; and undertaking discipline-based pedagogic research.

abstract = {Integrating more engineering contexts, introducing advanced engineering topics, addressing multiple ABET criteria, and serving under-represented student populations in foundation engineering courses are some of the opportunities realized by the use of a new framework for developing real-world client-driven problems. These problems are called model-eliciting activities (MEAs), and they are based on the models and modeling perspective developed in mathematics education. Through a NSF-HRD gender equity project that has funded the development, use, and study of MEAs in undergraduate engineering courses for increasing women's interest in engineering, we have found that the MEA framework fosters significant change in the way engineering faculty think about their teaching and their students. In this paper, we will present the six principles that guide the development of an MEA, detail our motivation for using the MEA framework to construct open-ended problems, and discuss the opportunities and challenges to creating, implementing, and assessing MEAs.

In addition, we encapsulated passaged cells in agarose to examine the effect of three-dimensional culture on redifferentiating zonal chondrocytes. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure the relative gene expression levels of collagen I and II, aggrecan, and superficial zone protein over relevant passages (P0{\textendash}P4).

abstract = {Collagen fibrils networks in knee cartilage and menisci change in content and structure from a region to another. While resisting tension, they influence global joint response as well as local strains particularly at short-term periods. To investigate the role of fibrils networks in knee joint mechanics and in particular cartilage response, a novel model of the knee joint is developed that incorporates the cartilage and meniscus fibrils networks as well as depth-dependent properties in cartilage. The joint response under up to 2000N compression is investigated for conditions simulating the absence in cartilage of deep fibrils normal to subchondral bone or superficial fibrils parallel to surface as well as localized split of cartilage at subchondral junction or localized damage to superficial fibrils at loaded areas. Deep vertical fibrils network in cartilage play a crucial role in stiffening (by 10%) global response and protecting cartilage by reducing large strains (from maximum of 102% to 38%), in particular at subchondral junction. Superficial horizontal fibrils protect the tissue mainly from excessive strains at superficial layers (from 27% to 8%). Local cartilage split at base disrupts the normal function of vertical fibrils at the affected areas resulting in higher strains. Deep fibrils, and to a lesser extent superficial fibrils, play dominant mechanical roles in cartilage response under transient compression. Any treatment modality attempting to repair or regenerate cartilage defects involving partial or full thickness osteochondral grafts should account for the crucial role of collagen fibrils networks and the demanding mechanical environment of the tissue.},

Five different cell types with varying abilities to express type II collagen were studied. Chick embryo chondrocytes express type II collagen, while 5-bromodeoxyuridine-treated chondrocytes, retinoic acid-treated chondrocytes, chick embryo fibroblasts, and erythrocytes do not synthesize type II collagen. Both cDNA and genomic probes for the pro-alpha 1(II) collagen gene were used, covering the complete 3' end of the gene and its flanking sequences. The pro-alpha 1(II) collagen DNA was undermethylated in chondrocytes, compared to either fibroblasts or erythrocytes. However, the methylation of the 5-bromodeoxyuridine-treated and retinoic acid-treated chondrocytes was identical to that of control chondrocytes. The methylation pattern of two regions of the gene of the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen chain was identical in all cell types tested, whether or not the gene was expressed. Our results indicate that genes for these collagen chains differ in their methylation pattern. The type II collagen gene shows reduced methylation in expressing cartilage, but does not acquire an increase in methylation in "dedifferentiated" chondrocytes. The changes in DNA methylation that occur during cell differentiation do not appear to be sufficient to explain gene activation and deactivation.},

In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

abstract = {The primary mechanical function of bones is to provide rigid levers for muscles to pull against, and to remain as light as possible to allow efficient locomotion. To accomplish this bones must adapt their shape and architecture to make efficient use of material. Bone adaptation during skeletal growth and development continuously adjusts skeletal mass and architecture to changing mechanical environments. There are three fundamental rules that govern bone adaptation: (1) It is driven by dynamic, rather than static, loading. (2) Only a short duration of mechanical loading is necessary to initiate an adaptive response. (3) Bone cells accommodate to a customary mechanical loading environment, making them less responsive to routine loading signals. From these rules, several mathematical equations can be derived that provide simple parametric models for bone adaptation.},

Just over 200 electrical and chemical engineering faculty in the US completed the survey. Results show that faculty members most commonly learn about RBIS from colleagues (18%). 98.6% of faculty report knowledge about one or more of the 12 RBIS asked about in the survey. 82.1% of faculty report use of one or more of these RBIS. The most common reason given for non-use was the fear that these strategies would take up too much class time.},

For in vitro investigation, ovine chondrocytes and BMSC were seeded on the matrix and cultured at different time points. Histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, biochemical assays for glycosaminoglycans, and real-time quantitative PCR for collagens were performed. The animal study described here included 22 chondral defects in 11 sheep, divided into four treatment groups. Group A: microfracture and collagen matrix seeded with chondrocytes; B: microfracture and unseeded matrices; C: microfracture; D: untreated defects. All animals were sacrificed 16 weeks after implantation, and a histomorphometrical and qualitative evaluation of the defects was performed. The in vitro investigation revealed viable cells up to 3 weeks; chondrocytes had a predominantly round morphology, produced glycosaminoglycans, and expressed both collagen markers, whereas BMSC stained positive for antibodies against type-II collagen; however, no mRNA for type-II collagen was amplified. All treatment groups of the animal model showed better defect filling compared to untreated knees. The cell-seeded group had the greatest quantity of repair tissue and the largest quantity of hyaline-like tissue. Although the collagen matrix is an adequate environment for BMSC in vitro, the additionally implanted unseeded collagen matrix did not increase the repair response after microfracture in chondral defects. Only the matrices seeded with autologous cells in combination with microfracture were able to facilitate the regeneration of hyaline-like cartilage.},

This study investigated if PRG4 is also synthesized and secreted by the cells within meniscus, and if PRG4 is also present in, and at the surface of, meniscus. PRG4 was visualized in sections of bovine calf menisci by immunohistochemistry. PRG4 was detected in two regions: (1) at the femoral and tibial surfaces of the meniscus, and within cells below these surfaces; and (2) within and near cells along the radial tie fibers and circumferential fibers. From meniscus tissue harvested from these surfaces, PRG4 was extracted with 4M GuHCl and quantified by ELISA. There was 0.20 +/- 0.01 and 0.25 +/- 0.04 microg PRG4/cm(2) area of lateral and medial meniscus surface, respectively. ELISA analysis of spent medium from other samples of meniscus surface tissue incubated in medium supplemented with serum and ascorbate showed that 8.1 +/- 1.1 microg PRG4/cm(2) area of meniscus surface was secreted over six days. These results demonstrate that PRG4 is synthesized and secreted by certain cell populations in the meniscus, and that PRG4 is present in the meniscus at surfaces and also internal fibers where it may contribute to boundary lubrication.},

abstract = {One of the challenges facing researchers studying chondrocyte mechanobiology is determining the range of mechanical forces pertinent to the problems they study. One possible way to deal with this problem is to quantify how the biomechanical behavior of cells varies in response to changing mechanical forces. In this study, the compressibility and recovery behaviors of single chondrocytes were determined as a function of compressive strains from 6 to 63%. Bovine articular chondrocytes from the middle and deep zones were subjected to this range of strains, and digital videocapture was used to track changes in cell dimensions during and after compression. The normalized volume change, apparent Poisson's ratio, residual strain after recovery, cell volume fraction after recovery, and characteristic recovery time constant were analyzed with respect to axial strain. Normalized volume change varied as a function of strain, demonstrating that chondrocytes exhibited compressibility. The mean Poisson's ratio of chondrocytes was found to be 0.29 +/- 0.14, and did not vary with axial strain. In contrast, residual strain, recovered volume fraction, and recovery time constant all depended on axial strain. The dependence of residual strain and recovered volume fraction on axial strain showed a change in behavior around 25-30% strain, opening up the possibility that this range of strains represents a critical value for chondrocytes. Quantifying the mechanical behavior of cells as a function of stress and strain is a potentially useful approach for identifying levels of mechanical stimulation that may be germane to normal cartilage physiology, functional tissue engineering of cartilage, and the etiopathogenesis of osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To determine the site variation of material properties and cellular biosynthetic activity, and to compare these at each site, of articular cartilage from the bovine carpo-metacarpal joint in order to test its usefulness as a model system for investigating the metabolic effects of mechanical stimuli.

DESIGN:The mechanical properties and composition of full-depth biopsies of articular cartilage were measured at defined sites in bovine carpometacarpal joints. Metabolic activity at the same sites was assessed by incubating further biopsies in medium containing 35S-sulfate and 3H-leucine then measuring the incorporated radioisotope and cell density. These results were compared with an estimate of the distribution of forces across the joint.

RESULTS:Topographical variation of water content, stiffness, cell count or incorporated radioisotope was not significant whereas collagen and glycosaminoglycan varied in different ways. A moderate correlation was found between water and collagen contents, but the correlation between water and glycosaminoglycan contents was poor. Neither compressive stiffness nor creep compliance was predicted strongly by any of the composition measurements. A negative correlation was found between metabolic activity and cell density.

CONCLUSIONS:Defining the variation of tissue properties across the bovine carpometacarpal joint and the lack of variation in biosynthetic activity will enable proper matching of experimental and control groups of biopsies in studies of the effects of mechanical stimuli on the composition and mechanical properties of articular cartilage. In addition, the lack of correlation between stiffness, water and glycosaminoglycan contents is further evidence that the mechanical properties of the tissue depend significantly on factors other than these broad measures of composition.},

abstract = {The extracellular matrix surrounding chondrocytes within a chondron is likely to affect the metabolic activity of these cells. In this study we investigated this by analyzing protein synthesis by intact chondrons obtained from different types of cartilage and compared this with chondrocytes. Chondrons and chondrocytes from goats from different cartilage sources (articular cartilage, nucleus pulposus, and annulus fibrosus) were cultured for 0, 7, 18, and 25 days in alginate beads. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that the gene expression of Col2a1 was consistently higher by the chondrons compared with the chondrocytes and the Col1a1 gene expression was consistently lower. Western blotting revealed that Type II collagen extracted from the chondrons was cross-linked. No Type I collagen could be extracted. The amount of proteoglycans was higher for the chondrons from articular cartilage and nucleus pulposus compared with the chondrocytes, but no differences were found between chondrons and chondrocytes from annulus fibrosus. The expression of both Mmp2 and Mmp9 was higher by the chondrocytes from articular cartilage and nucleus pulposus compared with the chondrons, whereas no differences were found with the annulus fibrosus cells. Gene expression of Mmp13 increased strongly by the chondrocytes (>50-fold), but not by the chondrons. Taken together, our data suggest that preserving the pericellular matrix has a positive effect on cell-induced cartilage production.},

abstract = {The electrophysiological properties of acutely isolated canine articular chondrocytes have been characterized using patch-clamp methods. The 'steady-state' current-voltage relationship (I-V) of single chondrocytes over the range of potentials from -100 to +40 mV was highly non-linear, showing strong outward rectification positive to the zero-current potential. Currents activated at membrane potentials negative to -50 mV were time independent, and the I-V from -100 to -60 mV was linear, corresponding to an apparent input resistance of 9.3 +/- 1.4 G Omega (n= 23). The outwardly rectifying current was sensitive to the K(+) channel blocking ion tetraethylammonium (TEA), which had a 50% blocking concentration of 0.66 mM (at +50 mV). The 'TEA-sensitive' component of the outwardly rectifying current had time- and membrane potential-dependent properties, activated near -45 mV and was half-activated at -25 mV. The reversal potential of the 'TEA-sensitive' current with external K(+) concentration of 5 mm and internal concentration of 145 mM, was -84 mV, indicating that the current was primarily carried by K(+) ions. The resting membrane potential of isolated chondrocytes (-38.1 +/- 1.4 mV; n= 19) was depolarized by 14.8 +/- 0.9 mV by 25 mM TEA, which completely blocked the K(+) current of these cells. These data suggest that this voltage-sensitive K(+) channel has an important role in regulating the membrane potential of canine articular chondrocytes.},

Chondrocyte culture plates were placed in a vibratory apparatus and subjected to a mechanical vibratory load at various frequencies and periods in culture. Mechanical vibration was applied at a sinusoidal waveform of 1.4 g acceleration with frequencies of 200, 300, 400, 800, and 1600 Hz. 3H-Thymidine and H2(35)SO4 incorporation were used to detect radiolabeled DNA and proteoglycan syntheses, respectively. A frequency of 300 Hz showed a time-dependent augmentation of DNA synthesis and gave a maximal increase at day 3 with periodic vibration (8 h per day) and at 72 h or longer with continuous vibration. It also promoted proteoglycan synthesis in long-term culture (from 3 to 15 days) by periodic vibration. However. frequencies above 400 Hz suppressed biosynthesis. These results suggest that mechanical vibration at certain frequencies may modulate biosynthetic response of articular chondrocytes.},

abstract = {The National Science Foundation funded a synthesis study on the status, contributions, and future direction of discipline-based education research (DBER) in physics, biological sciences, geosciences, and chemistry. DBER combines knowledge of teaching and learning with deep knowledge of discipline-specific science content. It describes the discipline-specific difficulties learners face and the specialized intellectual and instructional resources that can facilitate student understanding. Discipline-Based Education Research is based on a 30-month study built on two workshops held in 2008 to explore evidence on promising practices in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This book asks questions that are essential to advancing DBER and broadening its impact on undergraduate science teaching and learning. The book provides empirical research on undergraduate teaching and learning in the sciences, explores the extent to which this research currently influences undergraduate instruction, and identifies the intellectual and material resources required to further develop DBER. Discipline-Based Education Research provides guidance for future DBER research. In addition, the findings and recommendations of this report may invite, if not assist, post-secondary institutions to increase interest and research activity in DBER and improve its quality and usefulness across all natural science disciples, as well as guide instruction and assessment across natural science courses to improve student learning. The book brings greater focus to issues of student attrition in the natural sciences that are related to the quality of instruction. Discipline-Based Education Research will be of interest to educators, policy makers, researchers, scholars, decision makers in universities, government agencies, curriculum developers, research sponsors, and education advocacy groups.},

A single concept of what the students thought of as good teaching, and two categories ('pre-existing' and 'reflective') of what the teachers thought of as good teaching were developed. The extent to which these concepts overlap-and fail to overlap even after reflection-is used to discuss the importance of developing appropriate metacognitive strategies in human adult learning so that each group (teachers and learners) becomes more aware of what the other is attempting to do. The importance of out-of-class behaviours is seen as particularly valuable in this respect.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the equilibrium confined compression modulus of bovine articular cartilage as it varies with depth from the articular surface. Osteochondral samples were compressed by 8, 16, 24, and 32% of the cartilage thickness and allowed to equilibrate. Intratissue displacement within the cartilage was measured with use of fluorescently labeled chondrocyte nuclei as intrinsic, fiducial markers. Axial strain was then calculated in nine sequential 125 microns thick cartilage layers comprising the superficial 1,125 microns and in a 250 microns thick layer of cartilage adjacent to the cartilage-bone interface. Adjacent osteochondral cores were also tested in confined compression to determine the equilibrium stresses required to achieve the same levels of compression. Stress-strain data for each layer of each sample were fit to a finite deformation stress-strain relation to determine the equilibrium confined compression modulus in each tissue layer. The compressive modulus increased significantly with depth from the articular surface and ranged from 0.079 +/- 0.039 MPa in the superficial layer to 1.14 +/- 0.44 MPa in the ninth layer. The deepest layer 250 microns thick, had a modulus of 2.10 +/- 2.69 MPa. These moduli were markedly different from the apparent "homogeneous" modulus for full-thickness cartilage (0.38 +/- 0.12 MPa) and ranged from 21 to 560% of that value. The relatively low moduli and the compression-induced stiffening of the superficial layers suggest that these layers greatly affect the biomechanical behavior of cartilage, such as during confined compression testing. The delineation of the depth-dependent modulus provides a basis for detailed study of the relationship between the composition, structure, and function of cartilage in such processes as aging, repair, and degeneration.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage is subjected to dynamic compressive loading that is known to influence chondrocyte metabolism. While the exact signalling mechanisms are unclear, it has been proposed that cell deformation plays a role and may stimulate a metabolic response through distinctive pathways. In this study, a well characterized model system in which chondrocytes are embedded in agarose was used to study the effect of dynamic cellular strain on three key metabolic processes, namely the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan, of DNA, and of total protein. Using a specially designed apparatus, 15% compressive strain amplitude was applied to agarose-chondrocyte cylinders statically or dynamically over a range of frequencies (0.3-3 Hz). Static and low-frequency strain (0.3 Hz) inhibited the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan, while a frequency of 1 Hz stimulated synthesis. Static strain reduced the level of thymidine uptake, whereas dynamic strain at all frequencies induced an increase in chondrocyte proliferation. Incorporation of tritiated proline was suppressed by all strain regimens tested. The three parameters investigated were each influenced by the dynamic strain regimens in a distinct manner, implying that the signalling mechanisms involved are uncoupled.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:The collagen structure in the superficial zone of articular cartilage is critical to the tissue's durability. Early osteoarthritis is often characterized with fissures on the articular surface. This is closely related to the disruption of the collagen network. However, the traditional histology can not offer visualization of the collagen structure in articular cartilage because it uses conventional optical microscopy that does not have insufficient imaging resolution to resolve collagen from proteoglycans in hyaline articular cartilage. This study examines the 3D collagen network of articular cartilage scored from 0 to 2 in the scoring system of International Cartilage Repair Society, and aims to develop a 3D histology for assessing early osteoarthritis.

METHODS:Articular cartilage was visually classified into five physiological groups: normal cartilage, aged cartilage, cartilage with artificial and natural surface disruption, and fibrillated. The 3D collagen matrix of the cartilage was acquired using a 3D imaging technique developed previously. Traditional histology was followed to grade the physiological status of the cartilage in the scoring system of International Cartilage Repair Society.

RESULTS:Normal articular cartilage contains interwoven collagen bundles near the articular surface, approximately within the lamina splendens. However, its collagen fibres in the superficial zone orient predominantly in a direction spatially oblique to the articular surface. With age and disruption of the articular surface, the interwoven collagen bundles are gradually disappeared, and obliquely oriented collagen fibres change to align predominantly in a direction spatially perpendicular to the articular surface. Disruption of the articular surface is well related to the disappearance of the interwoven collagen bundles.

CONCLUSION:A 3D histology has been developed to supplement the traditional histology and study the subtle changes in the collagen network in the superficial zone during early physiological alteration of articular cartilage. The fibre confocal imaging technology used in this study has allowed developing confocal arthroscopy for in vivo studying the chondrocytes in different depth of articular cartilage. Therefore, the current study has potential to develop an in vivo 3D histology for diagnosis of early osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {Despite significant advances in stem cell differentiation and tissue engineering, directing progenitor cells into three-dimensionally (3D) organized, native-like complex structures with spatially-varying mechanical properties and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) composition has not yet been achieved. The key innovations needed to achieve this would involve methods for directing a single stem cell population into multiple, spatially distinct phenotypes or lineages within a 3D scaffold structure. We have previously shown that specific combinations of natural and synthetic biomaterials can direct marrow-derived stem cells (MSC) into varying phenotypes of chondrocytes that resemble cells from the superficial, transitional, and deep zones of articular cartilage. In this current study, we demonstrate that layer-by-layer organization of these specific biomaterial compositions creates 3D niches that allow a single MSC population to differentiate into zone-specific chondrocytes and organize into a complex tissue structure. Our results indicate that a three-layer polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogel with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive peptides (MMP-pep) incorporated into the top layer (superficial zone, PEG:CS:MMP-pep), CS incorporated into the middle layer (transitional zone, PEG:CS) and hyaluronic acid incorporated in the bottom layer (deep zone, PEG:HA), creates native-like articular cartilage with spatially-varying mechanical and biochemical properties. Specifically, collagen II levels decreased gradually from the superficial to the deep zone, while collagen X and proteoglycan levels increased, leading to an increasing gradient of compressive modulus from the superficial to the deep zone. We conclude that spatially-varying biomaterial compositions within single 3D scaffolds can stimulate efficient regeneration of multi-layered complex tissues from a single stem cell population.},

abstract = {We have previously identified megakaryocyte stimulating factor (MSF) gene expression by synovial fibroblasts as the origin of lubricin in the synovial cavity. Lubricin is a mucinous glycoprotein responsible for the boundary lubrication of articular cartilage. MSF has a significant homology to vitronectin and is composed of 12 exons. RNA was purified from human synovial fibroblasts and articular chondrocytes grown in vitro from tissue explants obtained from subjects without degenerative joint disease. RT-PCR was used with multiple complimentary primer pairs spanning the central mucin expressing exon 6 of the MSF gene and individual exons on both the N- and C-terminal sides of exon 6. Exons 2, 4 and 5 appear to be variably expressed by synovial fibroblasts and articular chondrocytes. Lubricating mucin, in the form of MSF, is expressed by both chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts in vitro. Both lubricin and superficial zone protein (SZP), a related proteoglycan, share a similar primary structure but could differ in post-translational modifications with O-linked oligosaccharides which are predominant in lubricin and with limited amounts chondroitin and keratan sulfate found in SZP. Since most of the MSF exons are involved in the expression of lubricating mucin, a strong homology to vitronectin persists. It is therefore appropriate to consider that both SZP and lubricin occupy a new class of biomolecules termed tribonectins. Screening of a human genome bacterial artificial chromsome (BAC) library with a cDNA primer pair complimentary for exon 6 identified two clones. Both clones were complimentary for chromosome 1q25 by in situ hybridization. This same locus was previously implicated in camptodactyl-arthropathy-pericarditis syndrome (CAP) by genetic mapping. It is hypothesized that CAP, a large joint arthropathy, may be associated with ineffective boundary lubrication provided by synovial fluid.},

The conclusions drawn from the evidence are that student learning can be improved significantly through such an intervention, and that this improvement may last over time and be transferable, at least within similar contexts. This work is a development within a longer and ongoing research project into criterion-referenced assessment tools and processes which has been undertaken in the pursuit of a conceptually sound and functional assessment framework that would promote and encourage common standards of assessment; that project is also summarised.},

During 1996, direct medical costs for persons with disability were $260 billion. Surveillance of disability prevalence and associated health conditions is useful in setting policy, anticipating the service needs of health systems, assisting state programs, directing health promotion and disease prevention efforts, and monitoring national health objectives. The U.S. Bureau of the Census and CDC analyzed data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to determine national prevalence estimates of adults with disabilities and associated health conditions. This report summarizes findings of that analysis, which indicate that disability continues to be an important public health problem, even among working adults, and arthritis or rheumatism, back or spine problems, and heart trouble/hardening of the arteries remain the leading causes. Better health promotion and disease prevention may reduce the prevalence of disability-associated health conditions.},

abstract = {Analysis of cellular mechanotransduction, the mechanism by which cells convert mechanical signals into biochemical responses, has focused on identification of critical mechanosensitive molecules and cellular components. Stretch-activated ion channels, caveolae, integrins, cadherins, growth factor receptors, myosin motors, cytoskeletal filaments, nuclei, extracellular matrix, and numerous other structures and signaling molecules have all been shown to contribute to the mechanotransduction response. However, little is known about how these different molecules function within the structural context of living cells, tissues, and organs to produce the orchestrated cellular behaviors required for mechanosensation, embryogenesis, and physiological control. Recent work from a wide range of fields reveals that organ, tissue, and cell anatomy are as important for mechanotransduction as individual mechanosensitive proteins and that our bodies use structural hierarchies (systems within systems) composed of interconnected networks that span from the macroscale to the nanoscale in order to focus stresses on specific mechanotransducer molecules. The presence of isometric tension (prestress) at all levels of these multiscale networks ensures that various molecular scale mechanochemical transduction mechanisms proceed simultaneously and produce a concerted response. Future research in this area will therefore require analysis, understanding, and modeling of tensionally integrated (tensegrity) systems of mechanochemical control.},

abstract = {Since the 1970s, school effectiveness research has looked for process-variables filling the black box between mainly structural school features and cognitive outcomes in students. Two concepts came to the fore: school climate and school culture. Both concepts are currently used interchangeably, although it is open to debate whether both are actually the same thing. Because of the way culture and climate are defined and subsequently measured, we propose school culture is a better frame from which to study school effectiveness. This article goes through the premises of perceptual measurement usually overlooked in climate research, and we demonstrate empirically by means of very basic and simple methods and techniques that perceptual measurement and measurement based on assumptions are different approaches and might yield totally different results on an aggregated level. We conclude by demonstrating how culture can be probed and integrated in the models traditionally used in school effectiveness research in an advantageous and theoretically sound way.},

abstract = {Chondrogenesis in cartilage development and repair and cartilage degeneration in arthritis can be regulated by mechanical-load-induced physical factors such as tissue deformation, interstitial fluid flow and pressure, and electrical fields or streaming potentials. Previous animal and tissue explant studies have shown that time-varying dynamic tissue loading can increase the synthesis and deposition of matrix molecules in an amplitude-, frequency-, and spatially dependent manner. To provide information on the cell-level physical factors which may stimulate chondrocytes to increase production and export of aggrecan, the main proteoglycan component of the cartilage matrix, we characterized local changes in aggrecan synthesis within cyclically loaded tissue explant disks and compared those changes to values of predicted local physical factors. Aggrecan synthesis following a 23-h compression/radiolabel protocol was measured with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.1 mm across the 1.5-mm radius of explanted disks using a quantitative autoradiography method. A uniform stimulation of aggrecan synthesis was observed at an intermediate frequency of 0.01 Hz, while, at a higher frequency of 0.1 Hz, stimulation was only seen at peripheral radial positions. Profiles of radial solid matrix deformation and interstitial fluid pressure and velocity predicted to be occurring across the radius of the disk during sinusoidal loading were estimated using a composite poroelastic model. Tissue regions experiencing high interstitial fluid velocities corresponded to those displaying increased aggrecan synthesis.

abstract = {To clarify the mechanism of cartilage degradation induced by mechanical stress, we investigated the influence of cyclic tension force (CTF) on the metabolism of cultured chondrocytes. The chondrocytes were exposed to CTF using a Flexercell strain unit. Five or 15 kPa of high frequency CTF significantly inhibited the syntheses of DNA, proteoglycan, collagen, and protein. Fifteen kPa of high frequency CTF induced the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 mRNA, and increased the production of pro- and active-MMP-9. The degradation of proteoglycan was inhibited by and MMP inhibitor, indicating that MMPs are involved in the degradation of proteoglycans induced by high frequency CTF. Moreover, reducing the frequency of CTF from high to low decreased the inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis. These findings suggest that the CTF frequency is one of the key determinants of chondrocyte metabolism. Low magnitude CTF, whether high or low frequency, did not cause the gene expression of cartilage degradation factors, suggesting that this CTF magnitude causes only minor changes in the cartilage matrix. High magnitude and frequency CTF caused the gene expression of IL-1 and MMP-9, followed by increases in the production of MMP-2 and -9 proteins, suggesting that excessive and continuous cyclic mechanical stress induces the production of IL-1 and MMP-9, resulting in cartilage degradation.},

abstract = {It is well accepted that mechanical forces can modulate the metabolic activity of chondrocytes, although the specific mechanisms of mechanical signal transduction in articular cartilage are still unknown. One proposed pathway through which chondrocytes may perceive changes in their mechanical environment is directly through cellular deformation. An important step toward understanding the role of chondrocyte deformation in signal transduction is to determine the changes in the shape and volume of chondrocytes during applied compression of the tissue. Recently, a technique was developed for quantitative morphometry of viable chondrocytes within the extracellular matrix using three-dimensional confocal scanning laser microscopy. In the present study, this method was used to quantify changes in chondrocyte morphology and local tissue deformation in the surface, middle, and deep zones in explants of canine articular cartilage subjected to physiological levels of matrix deformation. The results indicated that at 15% surface-to-surface equilibrium strain in the tissue, a similar magnitude of local tissue strain occurs in the middle and deep zones. In the surface zone, local strains of 19% were observed, indicating that the compressive stiffness of the surface zone is significantly less than that of the middle and deep zones. With this degree of tissue deformation, significant decreases in cellular height of 26, 19, and 20% and in cell volume of 22, 16, and 17% were observed in the surface, middle, and deep zones, respectively. The deformation of chondrocytes in the surface zone was anisotropic, with significant lateral expansion occurring in the direction perpendicular to the local split-line pattern. When compression was removed, there was complete recovery of cellular morphology in all cases. These observations support the hypothesis that deformation of chondrocytes or a change in their volume may occur during in vivo joint loading and may have a role in the mechanical signal transduction pathway of articular cartilage.},

abstract = {Approx. 10% of the total proteoglycan content of normal young human articular cartilage was extracted under associative conditions with Dulbecco's PBS. Proteoglycans isolated from the extract by Q-Sepharose chromatography were separated by gel chromatography and characterized by gradient gel SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting. Three species of small proteoglycans, two main populations of aggrecan and a population of its smaller fragments were identified. The major populations of aggrecan contained chondroitin sulphate chains, all or part of the N-terminal G1 and G2 domains and, therefore, intact keratan sulphate domains. The larger population was estimated by gradient SDS/PAGE to have a molecular mass of approx. 600 kDa or greater. The second population had an apparent molecular mass of approx. 300-600 kDa. Core proteins derived from these populations of proteoglycans separated on SDS/PAGE into several clusters of bands in the range from 120 to approx. 360 kDa. The extract further contained smaller fragments which lacked chondroitin sulphate but reacted with antibodies against keratan sulphate, and against epitopes present in the G2 domain of aggrecan. The presence of the G2 domain in a broad range of populations of decreasing size indicated extensive cleavage of the aggrecan core protein within its chondroitin sulphate domain. These findings suggest that fragmentation of aggrecan probably occurs in vivo in normal articular cartilage of young individuals. Associative extracts also contained decorin, biglycan and fibromodulin. These were resolved from aggrecan by gel chromatography and identified by immunodetection.},

This has raised the attention of many groups to focus on a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the establishment of altered DNA methylation, histone modifications patterns and miRNA expression. The improved understanding of these mechanisms we will in turn allow us to improve the strategies that can be used for epigenetic therapies. In this review we will discuss and summarize briefly our current knowledge of epigenetic alterations in leukemias and will turn our attention to a concrete example of epigenetic deregulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP$\alpha$), a key regulator for granulocytic differentiation of common myeloid progenitor cells in order to highlight the cooperativity of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms acting on this gene during the process of leukemogenesis.},

abstract = {A new immunoassay was developed to detect denaturation of type II collagen in osteoarthritis (OA). A peptide, alpha 1 (II)-CB11B, located in the CB11 peptide of type II collagen, was synthesized and used to produce a monoclonal antibody (COL2-3/4m) of the IgG1 (kappa) isotype. This reacts with a defined epitope in denatured but not native type II collagen and the alpha 3 chain of type XI collagen. The latter is present in very small amounts (about 1% wt/wt) in cartilage relative to the alpha 1 (II) chain. By using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, type II collagen denaturation and total type II collagen content were determined. The epitope recognized by the antibody was resistant to cleavage by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K which were used to extract alpha 1 (II)-CB11B from the denatured (alpha-chymotrypsin soluble) and residual native (proteinase K soluble) collagen alpha-chains, respectively, present in human femoral articular cartilage. Type II collagen content was significantly reduced from a mean (range) of 14% (9.2-20.8%) of wet weight in 8 normal cartilages to 10.3% (7.4-15.0%) in 16 OA cartilages. This decrease, which may result in part from an increased hydration, was accompanied by an increase in the percent denaturation of type II collagen in OA to 6.0% of total type II collagen compared with 1.1% in normal tissue. The percent denaturation was ordinarily greater in the more superficial zone than in the deep zone of OA cartilage.},

abstract = {Inspired by the depth-dependent inhomogeneity of articular cartilage, it was hypothesized that a novel layered agarose technique, using a 2% (wt/vol) top and a 3% (wt/vol) bottom layer, would create an inhomogenous tissue construct with distinct material properties in conjoined regions. The biochemical and mechanical development of these constructs was observed alongside uniform 2% and 3% constructs. Initially, uniform 3% agarose disks had the highest bulk Young's modulus (E(Y) approximately 28 kPa) of all groups. After 28 days of culture in 20% FBS-containing media, however, uniform 2% chondrocyte-seeded constructs achieved the highest Young's modulus compared to bilayered and 3% agarose disks. Though all three groups contained similar GAG content ( approximately 1.5% ww), uniform 2% agarose disks on day 28 possessed the highest collagen content ( approximately 1% ww). Unlike in either homogeneous construct type, microscopic analysis of axial strain fields in bilayered constructs in response to applied static compression revealed two mechanically disparate regions on day 0: a softer 2% layer and a stiffer 3% layer. With time in culture, this inhomogeneity became less distinct, as indicated by increased continuity in both the local displacement field and local E(Y), and depended on the level of FBS supplementation of the feed media, with lower FBS concentrations (10%) more closely maintaining the original distinction of material properties. These results shed positive light on a layered agarose technique for the production of inhomogeneous bilayered chondrocyte-seeded agarose constructs with applications for investigations of chondrocyte mechanotransduction and for possible use in the tissue engineering of inhomogeneous articular cartilage constructs.},

abstract = {Chondrocytes in cartilage are embedded in a matrix containing a high concentration of proteoglycans and hence of fixed negative charges. Their extracellular ionic environment is thus different from that of most cells, with extracellular Na+ being 250-350 mM and extracellular osmolality 350-450 mOsm. When chondrocytes are isolated from the matrix and incubated in standard culture medium (DMEM; osmolality 250-280 mOsm), their extracellular environment changes sharply. We incubated isolated bovine articular chondrocytes and cartilage slices in DMEM whose osmolality was altered over the range 250-450 mOsm by Na+ or sucrose addition. 35S-sulphate and 3H-proline incorporation rates were at a maximum when the extracellular osmolality was 350-400 mOsm for both freshly isolated chondrocytes and for chondrocytes in cartilage. The incorporation rate per cell of isolated chondrocytes was only 10% that of chondrocytes in situ both 4 and 24 hours after isolation. For freshly isolated chondrocytes, the rate increased 30-50% in DMEM to which NaCl or sucrose had been added to increase osmolality. In chondrocytes incubated overnight in DMEM, the rate was greatest in DMEM of normal osmolality and fell from the maximum in proportion to the change in osmolality. The effects of sucrose addition on incorporation rates were similar but not identical to those of Na+ addition. Changes in cell volume might be linked to changes in synthesis rates since the cell volume of chondrocytes (measured by Coulter-counter) increased 30-40% when the cells were removed from their in situ environment into DMEM. Synthesis rates can thus be partly regulated by changes in extracellular osmolality, which in cartilage is controlled by proteoglycan concentration. This provides a mechanism by which the chondrocytes can rapidly respond to changes in extracellular matrix composition.},

abstract = {We have developed a novel mechanically active cartilage culture device capable of modulating the interplay between compression and shear, at physiologic stress levels (2-5 MPa). This triaxial compression culture system subjects cylindrical cartilage explants to pulsatile axial compression from platen contact, plus pulsatile radially transverse compression from external fluid compression. These compressive loads can be independently modulated to impose stress states that resemble normal physiologic loading, and to investigate perturbations of individual components of the multi-axial stress state, such as increased shear stress. Based on the observation that joint incongruity predisposes cartilage to premature degeneration, we hypothesized that cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis would be inhibited under conditions of low transverse buttressing (high shear stress). To test this hypothesis, we compared ECM synthesis in human cartilage explants exposed to axial compression without transverse compression (high shear stress), versus explants exposed to axial compression plus an equal level of transverse compression (low shear stress). Both total (35)SO(4) incorporation and aggrecan-specific (35)SO(4) incorporation were significantly inhibited by axial compression, relative to axial plus transverse compression.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the in vitro behaviour of bovine chondrocytes seeded in collagen gels, promising recently reported scaffolds for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects. To determine how chondrocytes respond to a collagen gel environment, 2 x 10(6) chondrocytes isolated from fetal, calf and adult bovine cartilage were seeded within type I collagen gels and grown for 12 days in both attached and floating (detached from the culture dish after polymerisation) conditions. Monolayer cultures were performed in parallel. All chondrocytes contracted floating gels to 55% of the initial size, by day 12. Contraction was dependent on initial cell density and inhibited by the presence of dihydrocytochalasin B as previously observed with fibroblasts. Gene expression was determined using conventional and real-time PCR. The chondrocyte phenotype was better maintained in floating gels compared to attached gels and monolayers. This was demonstrated by comparing the ratio of COL2A1/ COL1A2 mRNA and also of alpha10/alpha11 integrin mRNA. A strong up-regulation of MMP13 expression was measured at day 12 in floating gels. The composition of cartilage-like tissue obtained by growing chondrocytes in a collagen gel varied depending on the floating or attached conditions and initial cell density. It is thus important to consider these parameters when using this culture system in order to prepare a well-defined implant for cartilage repair.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Mechanical stimuli are of crucial importance for the development and maintenance of articular cartilage. For conditioning of cartilaginous tissues, various bioreactor systems have been developed that have mainly aimed to produce cartilaginous grafts for tissue engineering applications. Emphasis has been on in vitro preconditioning, whereas the same devices could be used to attempt to predict the response of the cells in vivo or as a prescreening method before animal studies. As a result of the complexity of the load and motion patterns within an articulating joint, no bioreactor can completely recreate the in vivo situation.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:This article aims to classify the various loading bioreactors into logical categories, highlight the response of mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes to the various stimuli applied, and determine which data could be used within a clinical setting.

METHODS:We performed a Medline search using specific search terms, then selectively reviewed relevant research relating to physical stimulation of chondrogenic cells in vitro, focusing on cellular responses to the specific load applied.

RESULTS:There is much data pertaining to increases in chondrogenic gene expression as a result of controlled loading protocols. Uniaxial loading leads to selective upregulation of genes normally associated with a chondrogenic phenotype, whereas multiaxial loading results in a broader pattern of chondrogenic gene upregulation. The potential for the body to be used as an in vivo bioreactor is being increasingly explored.

CONCLUSIONS:Bioreactors are important tools for understanding the potential response of chondrogenic cells within the joint environment. However, to replicate the natural in vivo situation, more complex motion patterns are required to induce more physiological chondrogenic gene upregulation.},

abstract = {A chondrocyte produces a hydrated pericellular matrix (PCM); together they form a chondron. Previous work has shown that the presence of the PCM influences the biological response of chondrocytes to loading. The objective of this study was to determine the gene expression profiles of enzymatically isolated single chondrocytes and chondrons in response to dynamic compression. Cartilage specific extracellular matrix components and transcription factors were examined. Following dynamic compression, chondrocytes and chondrons showed variations in gene expression profiles. Aggrecan, Type II collagen and osteopontin gene expression were significantly increased in chondrons. Lubricin gene expression decreased in both chondrons and chondrocytes. Dynamic compression had no effect on SOX9 gene expression. Our results demonstrate a clear role for the PCM in interfacing the mechanical signalling in chondrocytes in response to dynamic compression. Further investigation of single chondrocytes and chondrons from different zones within articular cartilage may further our understanding of cartilage mechanobiology.},

abstract = {In order to study proteoglycan retention and accumulation, we optimized a chondrocyte cell culture system in which isolated bovine articular chondrocytes accumulate extracellular matrix to form a continuous layer of cartilagenous tissue. The tissue can attain a thickness of up to 110 microns by 35 days. The cells synthesize large keratan sulfate containing proteoglycans and type II collagen indicating that the chondrocytes maintain their phenotype in these culture conditions. Matrix accumulation is enhanced by increased cell density and the presence of serum and ascorbic acid. The amount of proteoglycans synthesized by the chondrocytes increases up to day 21 and then decreases to the same levels as are synthesized during the first week of culture. The percentage of newly synthesized proteoglycans retained in the matrix increases from 20% on day 6 to a maximum of 85% by day 35. The proteoglycan and collagen content in the tissue increases with time in culture. The changes in the percentage of proteoglycans retained parallels the increase in proteoglycan content. After day 35, there is no further increase in the amount of proteoglycans and collagen nor in the percentage of newly synthesized proteoglycans retained in the extracellular matrix. These studies demonstrate that the cultures are going through two phases: one of matrix accumulation and then one of maintaining the existing matrix. The period of matrix accumulation occurs between days 10-21 whereas matrix maintenance is observed after day 35. Using this culture system to study proteoglycan accumulation and maintenance during these culture periods may prove useful in identifying the mechanisms regulating these processes.},

abstract = {1. Cyclical pressurization of cultured chondrocytes results in increases in cyclic AMP and in the rate of proteoglycan synthesis. Intermittent increases in hydrostatic pressure are also associated with hyperpolarization of chondrocyte cell membranes and activation of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-ion channels but the physiological basis for this response to mechanical stimulation is unclear. 2. Experiments have been undertaken to better define the types of ion channels involved and to explore the possibility that the hyperpolarization response associated with cyclical pressurization of chondrocytes follows activation of stretch-activated ion channels. 3. The mean membrane potential of chondrocytes in non-confluent monolayer cell culture rose from -15.3 +/- 0.24 mV to -21.1 +/- 0.28 mV (n = 60, P < 0.0001) after intermittent pressurization (0.33 Hz, 16 kPa, 20 min). 4. Strain gauge measurements showed that cyclical pressurization was associated with strain on the base of the culture plate. The amplitude of the hyperpolarization response was proportional to the microstrain to which cells were subjected. 5. Membrane hyperpolarization did not occur when chondrocytes were subjected to cyclical pressurization in rigid glass culture dishes or plastic dishes positioned in the pressurization chamber so as to avoid bending of the base of the culture dish. 6. Indirect evidence that the hyperpolarization response after intermittent pressure-induced strain was associated with stimulation of stretch-activated ion channels was obtained from experiments with gadolinium, amiloride and hexamethylene amiloride, each of which abolished hyperpolarization. 7. Experiments with apamin, charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin showed that the Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels involved in the hyperpolarization response are apamin-sensitive, charybdotoxin- and iberiotoxin-resistant, low-conductance channels. 8. Somatostatin and cadmium chloride, which block L-type calcium channels, abolished strain-induced chondrocyte hyperpolarization. EGTA, which chelates extracellular Ca2+, reduced the response to 48% of control values, and thapsigargin, which raises intracellular Ca2+ by inhibition of Ca(2+)-ATPase in endoplasmic reticulum, caused hyperpolarization independently with further hyperpolarization after pressure-induced strain. These data indicate that chondrocyte hyperpolarization was dependent on intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. 9. Further work is required to determine whether stretch-activated ion channels shown to be associated with chondrocyte hyperpolarization after cyclical pressure-induced strain are also involved in the signal transduction process that leads to increases in proteoglycan synthesis.},

Two hundred and eighteen third-year pre-service teachers were assigned to either non-rubric or rubric self-assessment for designing a conceptual map. They then assessed their own maps. The dependent variables were self-regulation measured through a questionnaire and an open question on learning strategies use, performance based on an expert-assigned score, accuracy comparing self-scores with the expert{\textquoteright}s scores and task stress using one self-reported item. The results showed that the rubric group reported higher learning strategies use, performance and accuracy. However, the rubric group also reported more problems coping with stress and higher performance/avoidance self-regulation that was detrimental to learning.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To review the basic scientific status of repair in articular cartilage tissue and to assess the efficiency of current clinical therapies instigated for the treatment of structural lesions generated therein as a result of trauma or during the course of various diseases, notably osteoarthritis (OA). Current scientific trends and possible directions for the future will also be discussed.

DESIGN:A systematic and critical analysis is undertaken, beginning with a description of the spontaneous repair responses in different types of lesion. Surgical interventions aimed at inducing repair without the use of active biologics will then be considered, followed by those involving active biologics and those drawing on autogenic and allogeneic tissue transplantation principles. Cell transplantation approaches, in particular novel tissue engineering concepts, will be critically presented. These will include growth-factor-based biological treatments and gene transfection protocols. A number of technical problems associated with repair interventions, such as tissue integration, tissue retention and the role of mechanical factors, will also be analysed.

RESULTS:A critical analysis of the literature reveals the existence of many novel and very promising biologically-based approaches for the induction of articular cartilage repair, the vast majority of which are still at an experimental phase of development. But prospective, double-blinded clinical trials comparing currently practiced surgical treatments have, unfortunately, not been undertaken.

CONCLUSION:The existence of many new and encouraging biological approaches to cartilage repair justifies the future investment of time and money in this research area, particularly given the extremely high socio-economic importance of such therapeutic strategies in the prevention and treatment of these common joint diseases and traumas. Clinical epidemiological and prospective trials are, moreover, urgently needed for an objective, scientific appraisal of current therapies and future novel approaches.},

abstract = {Identifying a source of sufficient numbers of chondrocytes for cartilage tissue engineering is a major factor limiting its use clinically. Previously we demonstrated that combined coculture of passaged dedifferentiated articular chondrocytes with primary bovine chondrocytes will induce their redifferentiation. In this study we determine whether these two cell types have to be in contact, whether human chondrocytes respond similarly, and whether the ability of primary cells to influence passaged cells depends on the age of the donor. Coculture of primary and passaged bovine chondrocytes grown on filter inserts placed in the same culture well but not in direct contact resulted in the passaged cells accumulating matrix rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen. There was upregulation of type II collagen and Sox9 and decrease in type I collagen gene expression in the passaged cells, to levels not significantly different from those of primary chondrocytes. Passaged chondrocytes obtained from older animals responded similarly to cells from younger animals. Further, passaged human chondrocytes were also induced to form cartilage tissue when placed in side-by-side culture with bovine chondrocytes; these data suggest that a soluble factor(s) may be responsible for redifferentiation of passaged chondrocytes and that it is not species specific. The responsiveness of human chondrocytes to this factor(s) suggests that this approach may be suitable to overcome the problem of limited chondrocyte numbers for cartilage tissue engineering.},

abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an "information rich" environment and interactions between the chondrocyte and ECM regulate many biological processes important to cartilage homeostasis and repair including cell attachment, growth, differentiation, and survival. The integrin family of cell surface receptors appears to play a major role in mediating cell-matrix interactions that are important in regulating these processes. Chondrocytes have been found to express several members of the integrin family which can serve as receptors for fibronectin (alpha 5 beta 1), types II and VI collagen (alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 10 beta 1), laminin (alpha 6 beta 1), and vitronectin and osteopontin (alpha V beta 3). Integrin expression can be regulated by growth factors including IGF-I and TGF-beta. By providing a link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton, integrins may be important transducers of mechanical stimuli. Integrin binding stimulates intracellular signaling which can affect gene expression and regulate chondrocyte function. Further studies are needed to more clearly define the role of integrins in cartilage.},

abstract = {X-ray diffraction has been used to measure the preferred orientation of the collagen fibrils, and their angular distribution within the tissue, as a function of depth from the articular surface in patellar cartilage. Measurements have been made at four different sites chosen to represent differing surface curvatures and regimes of wear. The orientation of fibrils in the surface layer allows it to oppose the swelling pressure exerted by the gel of hydrated glycosaminoglycans within the cartilage. An intermediate layer (where a bimodal distribution of fibrils is sometimes resolved) allows the orientation of the fibrils to change, with increasing depth, until they are roughly perpendicular to the articular surface. In this deep layer the fibrils can tie into the underlying calcified tissue so as to firmly anchor the cartilage. In the plane of the surface the fibrils tend to be aligned in the direction of stress caused by motion.},

abstract = {It has been well established that articular cartilage is compositionally and mechanically inhomogenous through its depth. To what extent this structural inhomogeneity is a prerequisite for appropriate cartilage function and integrity is not well understood. The first hypothesis to be tested in this study was that the depth-dependent inhomogeneity of the cartilage acts to maximize the interstitial fluid load support at the articular surface, to provide efficient frictional and wear properties. The second hypothesis was that the inhomogeneity produces a more homogeneous state of elastic stress in the matrix than would be achieved with uniform properties. We have, for the first time, simultaneously determined depth-dependent tensile and compressive properties of human patellofemoral cartilage from unconfined compression stress relaxation tests. The results show that the tensile modulus increases significantly from 4.1 +/- 1.9 MPa in the deep zone to 8.3 +/- 3.7 MPa at the superficial zone, while the compressive modulus decreases from 0.73 +/- 0.26 MPa to 0.28 +/- 0.16 MPa. The experimental measurements were then implemented with the finite-element method to compute the response of an inhomogeneous and homogeneous cartilage layer to loading. The finite-element models demonstrate that structural inhomogeneity acts to increase the interstitial fluid load support at the articular surface. However, the state of stress, strain, or strain energy density in the solid matrix remained inhomogeneous through the depth of the articular layer, whether or not inhomogeneous material properties were employed. We suggest that increased fluid load support at the articular surface enhances the frictional and wear properties of articular cartilage, but that the tissue is not functionally adapted to produce homogeneous stress, strain, or strain energy density distributions. Interstitial fluid pressurization, but not a homogeneous elastic stress distribution, appears thus to be a prerequisite for the functional and morphological integrity of the cartilage.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage damage in the young adult knee, if left untreated, it may proceed to degenerative osteoarthritis and is a serious cause of disability and loss of function. Surgical cartilage repair of an osteochondral defect can give the patient significant relief from symptoms and preserve the functional life of the joint. Several techniques including bone marrow stimulation, cartilage tissue based therapy, cartilage cell seeded therapies and osteotomies have been described in the literature with varying results. Established techniques rely mainly on the formation of fibro-cartilage, which has been shown to degenerate over time due to shear forces. The implantation of autologous cultured chondrocytes into an osteochondral defect, may replace damaged cartilage with hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage. This clinical review assesses current surgical techniques and makes recommendations on the most appropriate method of cartilage repair when managing symptomatic osteochondral defects of the knee. We also discuss the experience with the technique of autologous chondrocyte implantation at our institution over the past 11 years.},

abstract = {Many studies have illustrated the effect of mechanical loading on articular cartilage and the corresponding changes in chondrocyte metabolism, yet the mechanism through which the cells respond to loading still is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the change in shape of chondrocytes under a statically applied uniaxial compressive load. Isolated chondrocytes from rat chondrosarcoma were embedded in 2% agarose gel. Strains of 5, 10, and 15% were applied, and images of the cell were recorded from initial loading to equilibrium (15 minutes). A finite-element model was used to model the experimental setup and to estimate the mechanical properties of the chondrocyte at equilibrium. The transient behavior of the composite in the experiment was analyzed with use of a standard linear viscoelastic model. We found that all cells decreased in cross-sectional area under each of the applied compressive strains. In the finite-element model, the elasticity of the chondrocyte was similar to that of the surrounding agarose gel (4.0 kPa) and had a Poisson's ratio of 0.4. Viscoelastic analysis showed that the chondrocytes contributed a significant viscoelastic component to the behavior of the composite in comparison with the agarose gel alone. If a decrease in cell volume proportional to the decrease in cross-sectional area is assumed, the decrease observed was greater than would be predicted by a passive cellular response due to an equivalent osmotic pressure. This indicates that the chondrocyte may be altering its intracellular composition by cellular processes in response to mechanical loading.},

abstract = {Synovial fluid is a semidilute hyaluronate (HA) polymer solution, the rheology of which depends on HA-protein interactions, and lubricin is a HA-binding protein found in synovial fluid and at cartilage surfaces, where it contributes to boundary lubrication under load. Individuals with genetic deficiency of lubricin develop precocious joint failure. The role of lubricin in synovial fluid rheology is not known. We used a multiple-particle-tracking microrheology technique to study the molecular interactions between lubricin and HA in synovial fluid. Particles (200 nm mean diameter) embedded in normal and lubricin-deficient synovial fluid samples were tracked separately by using multiple-particle-tracking microrheology. The time-dependent ensemble-averaged mean-squared displacements of all of the particles were measured over a range of physiologically relevant frequencies. The mean-squared displacement correlation with time lag had slopes with values of unity for simple HA solutions and for synovial fluid from an individual who genetically lacked lubricin, in contrast to slopes with values less than unity (alpha approximately 0.6) for normal synovial fluid. These data correlated with bulk rheology studies of the same samples. We found that the subdiffusive and elastic behavior of synovial fluid, at physiological shear rates, was absent in fluid from a patient who lacks lubricin. We conclude that lubricin provides synovial fluid with an ability to dissipate strain energy induced by mammalian locomotion, which is a chondroprotective feature that is distinct from boundary lubrication.},

The organizational culture of the research university is highly complex, because, in part, of the multifarious demands on and activities of the institution. This article examines the culture that pervades the research university, the problematic conflict between the cultures of university and of discipline, the implications of organizational culture for meaning formation and the reduction of uncertainty. Since this is the culture in which many LIS programs exist, the implications of the culture, especially regarding determination of success, are explored.},

abstract = {Dynamic deformational loading has been shown to significantly increase the development of material properties of chondrocyte-seeded agarose hydrogels, however little is known about the spatial development of the material properties within these constructs. In this study, a technique that combines video microscopy and optimized digital image correlation, was applied to assess the spatial development of material properties in tissue-engineered cartilage constructs cultured in free-swelling and dynamically-loaded conditions (3h/day, 5 days/week, and maintained in free-swelling conditions when not being loaded) over a 6-week period. Although homogeneous at day 0, both free-swelling and dynamically loaded samples progressively developed stiffer outer edges and a softer central region. The distribution of GAGs and collagens were shown to mimic this profile. These results indicate that although dynamic loading augments the development of bulk properties in these samples, possibly by overcoming some of the diffusion limitation and nutrient transport issues, the overall profile of construct properties in the axial direction remains qualitatively the same as in free-swelling culture conditions. Poisson's ratio of these constructs increased over time in culture with increased fixed charged density contributed by the GAGs, but this increase was significantly less in dynamically loaded samples by day 42. Polarized light microscopy of Picrosirius Red labeled samples, at an angle perpendicular to the direction of loading, suggests that these differences in Poisson's ratio may be due to improved organization of collagen network in the dynamically loaded samples.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To provide a single source for the best available estimates of the US prevalence of and number of individuals affected by arthritis overall, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, the spondylarthritides, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome. A companion article (part II) addresses additional conditions.

METHODS:The National Arthritis Data Workgroup reviewed published analyses from available national surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). For analysis of overall arthritis, we used the NHIS. Because data based on national population samples are unavailable for most specific rheumatic conditions, we derived estimates from published studies of smaller, defined populations. For specific conditions, the best available prevalence estimates were applied to the corresponding 2005 US population estimates from the Census Bureau, to estimate the number affected with each condition.

RESULTS:More than 21% of US adults (46.4 million persons) were found to have self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis. We estimated that rheumatoid arthritis affects 1.3 million adults (down from the estimate of 2.1 million for 1995), juvenile arthritis affects 294,000 children, spondylarthritides affect from 0.6 million to 2.4 million adults, systemic lupus erythematosus affects from 161,000 to 322,000 adults, systemic sclerosis affects 49,000 adults, and primary Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome affects from 0.4 million to 3.1 million adults.

CONCLUSION:Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions continue to be a large and growing public health problem. Estimates for many specific rheumatic conditions rely on a few, small studies of uncertain generalizability to the US population. This report provides the best available prevalence estimates for the US, but for most specific conditions, more studies generalizable to the US or addressing understudied populations are needed.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the depth-dependent metabolic and structural responses of adult articular cartilage to large-strain, static, unconfined compression. Changes in cell biosynthetic activity and several morphometry-based structural parameters (cell density, cell volume fraction, cell surface-area density, mean cell surface area, and mean cell volume) were measured at eight sites representing different depth-zones between the articular surface and the cartilage/bone border. In addition, local axial strain in the superficial, transitional, upper radial, and lower radial zones was estimated on the basis of the change in cell density values. Static compression of articular cartilage revealed a highly heterogeneous deformation profile through the depth of the sample as well as zone-specific changes in biosynthetic activity, as reflected by incorporation of [3H]proline. The axial strains in the top layers were greater than the applied surface-to-surface strain, whereas axial strains adjacent to the cartilage/bone border were significantly less than the applied strain. Zonal changes in cell density and axial strain that occurred during static compression correlated well with alterations in metabolic activity. These coordinated changes between cell biosynthesis and cartilage structure suggest that zone-specific variations in mechanical stimuli could be responsible for spatially varied patterns of cartilage metabolic activity under load.},

abstract = {The pericellular matrix (PCM) surrounding chondrocytes is thought to play an important role in transmitting biochemical and biomechanical signals to the cells, which regulates many cellular functions including tissue homeostasis. To better understand chondrocytes interactions with their PCM, three-dimensional poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels containing Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), the cell-adhesion sequence found in fibronectin and which is present in the PCM of cartilage, were employed. RGD was incorporated into PEG hydrogels via tethers at 0.1, 0.4 and 0.8 mM concentrations. Bovine chondrocytes were encapsulated in the hydrogels and subjected to dynamic compressive strains (0.3 Hz, 18% amplitude strain) for 48h, and their response assessed by cell morphology, ECM gene expression, cell proliferation and matrix synthesis. Incorporation of RGD did not influence cell morphology under free swelling conditions. However, the level of cell deformation upon an applied strain was greater in the presence of RGD. In the absence of dynamic loading, RGD appears to have a negative effect on chondrocyte phenotype, as seen by a 4.7-fold decrease in collagen II/collagen I expressions in 0.8mM RGD constructs. However, RGD had little effect on early responses of chondrocytes (i.e. cell proliferation and matrix synthesis/deposition). When isolating RGD as a biomechanical cue, cellular response was very different. Chondrocyte phenotype (collagen II/collagen I ratio) and proteoglycan synthesis were enhanced with higher concentrations of RGD. Overall, our findings demonstrate that RGD ligands enhance cartilage-specific gene expression and matrix synthesis, but only when mechanically stimulated, suggesting that cell-matrix interactions mediate chondrocyte response to mechanical stimulation.},

Thus differences among practitioners of the various disciplines are pervasive and aptly described as cultural ones, and interdisciplinary work requires transcending unconscious habits of thought. The more those unconscious habits are explicated and the more we understand how the disparate characteristics of the various intellectual cultures are related to the necessarily different interests, values, and epistemologies, the more feasible becomes the goal of transcending thought habits. Two sorts of interdisciplinary effort seem to have been successful: specific, delimited problems have been solved by teams in what is actually multidisciplinary rather than interdisciplinary work, and new disciplines have sprung up at the intersections of existing ones. STS fits neither of those patterns. Can it nevertheless be viable?},

abstract = {The intact surface of articular cartilage is a highly organized structure composed of a variety of macromolecules. The studies reported here deal with a partial characterization of the non-covalently bound components of the outermost layer of articular cartilage. Normal bovine and human cartilage articular surfaces were extracted for 5 min with 4-M guanidine HCl solution. Analysis and quantitation of small proteoglycans in the extract were carried out by PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), Western blot, and radioimmunoassays. The present studies indicate that the major proteins extracted from the articular surface of bovine and human cartilage are the collagen-binding small proteoglycans designated as fibromodulin and albumin. Fibronectin, decorin, and biglycan were also detected in smaller amounts. Immunoblotting of the surface material developed with a monoclonal antibody with keratan sulfate specificity confirmed the presence of fibromodulin coinciding with the major protein band of approximately 70-100-kDa molecular mass. Gel filtration chromatography of the surface material confirmed the previous results. Additional in vitro assays showed that the collagen-binding material extracted from the cartilage surface contained the small proteoglycans. Anti-human fibromodulin antibodies bound in significantly greater amounts to the intact articular surfaces than to cut surfaces of normal human cartilage. It is concluded that small, non-aggregating proteoglycans constitute the major proteoglycan species non-covalently bound to macromolecules at the articular surface of cartilage partially responsible for the interference of anti-collagen type II antibody binding and for the inhibition of cell adhesion to the intact surface.},

abstract = {This study has been based on the assumption that articular motion is an important aspect of mechanotransduction in synovial joints. For this reason a new bioreactor concept, able to reproduce joint kinematics more closely, has been designed. The prototype consists of a rotating scaffold and/or cartilage pin, which is pressed onto an orthogonally rotating ball. By oscillating pin and ball in phase difference, elliptical displacement trajectories are generated that are similar to the motion paths occurring in vivo. Simultaneously, dynamic compression may be applied with a linear actuator, while two-step-motors generate the rotation of pin and ball. The whole apparatus is placed in an incubator. The control station is located outside. Preliminary investigations at the gene expression level demonstrated promising results. Compared with free-swelling control and/or simply compression-loaded samples, chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds as well as nasal cartilage explants exposed to interface motion both showed elevated levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein mRNA. The final design of the bioreactor will include four individual stations in line, which will facilitate the investigation of motion-initiated effects at the contacting surfaces in more detail.},

abstract = {The evaluation of critical thinking, as with any other measure, must employ instruments that meet appropriate psychometric standards. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometricproperties of the two California Critical Thinking Tests. Two samples of undergraduate students enrolled in a southern comprehensive university took the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (TST) and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory (TDI). A portion of the participants, who were nursing students, were retested on the TST and TDI two weeks after the initial testing. Some participants also completed the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (WGCTA). In both samples the TST had neither sufficient psychometric properties to assess individual abilities nor sufficient stability reliability. In particular, the analysis subscale of the TST demonstrated exceptional weakness in all administrations. In contrast, the TDI demonstrated very good reliability estimates in all administrations of the test. The data did not conform to the subscale structure during factor analysis. Whereas the TST needs further refinement, the TDI demonstrated sufficient reliability for use in attitudinal research.},

abstract = {Cells actively probe the stiffness of their surrounding and respond to it. The authors recently found that maintenance of the chondrogenic phenotype was directly influenced by this property in 2D. Since studies about this process in 3D are still largely absent, this study aimed to transfer this knowledge into a 3D environment. Agarose was modified with RGD to allow active stiffness sensing or RGE as a control. Hydrogels with different mechanical properties were produced by using different concentrations of agarose. Primary chondrocytes were incorporated into the gel, cultured for up to two weeks, and then constructs were analyzed. Cells were surrounded by their own ECM from an early stage and maintained their chondrogenic phenotype, independent of substrate composition, as indicated by a high collagen type II and a lack of collagen type I production. However, softer gels showed higher DNA and GAG content and larger cell clusters than stiff gels in both RGD- and RGE-modified agarose. The authors hypothesize that matrix elasticity in the tested range does not influence the maintenance of the chondrogenic phenotype in 3D but rather the size of the formed cell ECM clusters. The deviation of these findings from previous results in 2D stresses the importance of moving towards 3D systems that more closely mimic in vivo conditions.

abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease that involves degeneration of articular cartilage, limited intraarticular inflammation manifested by synovitis and changes in the subchondral bone. The aetiology of OA is largely unknown, but since it may involve multiple factors, including mechanical, biochemical and genetic factors, it has been difficult to identify unique targets for therapy. Chondrocytes, which are the unique cellular component of adult articular cartilage, are capable of responding to structural changes in the surrounding cartilage matrix. Since the initial stages of OA involve increased cell proliferation and synthesis of matrix proteins, proteinases and cytokines in the cartilage, laboratory investigations have focused on the chondrocyte as a target for therapeutic intervention. The capacity of the adult articular chondrocyte to regenerate the normal cartilage matrix architecture is limited, however, and the damage becomes irreversible unless the destructive process is interrupted. Current pharmacological interventions that address chronic pain are insufficient and no proven disease-modifying therapy is available. Identification of methods for early diagnosis is of key importance, since therapeutic interventions aimed at blocking or reversing structural damage will be more effective when there is the possibility of preserving normal homeostasis. At later stages, cartilage tissue engineering with or without gene therapy with anabolic factors will also require therapy to inhibit inflammation and block damage to newly repaired cartilage. This review will focus on experimental approaches currently under study that may lead to elucidation of effective strategies for therapy in OA, with emphasis on mediators that affect the function of chondrocytes and interactions with surrounding tissues.},

Cartilage has a low cell content and contains an extracellular matrix rich in proteoglycans, which copurify with the RNA as they are large and negatively charged macromolecules. In our laboratory, we are interested in searching for genes differentially expressed in chondrocytes in diverse in vivo situations, for instance during maturation of chondrocytes in the growth plate or during cartilage degeneration. We found that treatment by proteinase K in 1 M guanidinium isothiocyanate prior to cesium trifluoroacetate ultracentrifugation was crucial to increase the yield and purity of RNA extracted from cartilage matrix. This protocol indeed led to reproducible patterns of differential display reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and should be useful for identifying genes differentially expressed by chondrocytes in situ.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:This study was designed to quantify the role of the pericellular matrix (PCM) in chondrocyte apoptosis using chondrons, which are a cartilage functional unit including a chondrocyte and its associated PCM.

METHODS:Chondrocytes and chondrons were enzymatically isolated from human articular cartilage and exposed to monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) and staurosporine for apoptosis induction. Chondrons were defined by the presence of type VI collagen, a basic component of the PCM. Apoptosis of chondrocytes and chondrons was measured with annexin V binding by flow cytometry and verified with terminal dUTP nick end-labeling staining. In a separate experiment, isolated chondrocytes were treated with soluble type VI collagen, before or after apoptosis induction with MIA, and cell death was measured by the activity of LDH and terminal dUTP nick end-labeling staining.

RESULTS:Chondrocytes treated with MIA incurred 27% cell death, compared with 12% in chondrons. On treating with MIA, 9% of chondrocytes underwent apoptosis, compared with only 1.6% of chondrons. Similarly, staurosporine induced 13% apoptosis in chondrocytes, whereas it was 3% in chondrons. Preincubation of type VI collagen effectively prevented chondrocytes from MIA-induced cell death. After apoptosis was induced with MIA, however, treatment with type VI collagen failed to rescue chondrocytes from death.

CONCLUSION:The PCM, a native microenvironment of chondrocytes, protects chondrocytes from apoptosis. Type VI collagen is a functional component of the PCM that contributes to the survival of chondrocytes.},

abstract = {The formation of cartilaginous tissue in vitro is a promising alternative to repair damaged articular cartilage. However, recent attempts to tissue-engineer articular cartilage that has similar properties to the native tissue have proven to be difficult. The in vitro-formed cartilaginous tissue typically has a similar proteoglycan content to native cartilage, but has a reduced collagen content and only a fraction of the mechanical properties. In this study, we investigated whether the intermittent application of cyclic shearing forces during tissue formation would improve the tissue quality. Chondrocyte cultures were stimulated at a 2% shear strain amplitude at a frequency of 1 Hz for 400 cycles every 2nd day. At one week, both collagen and proteoglycan synthesis increased (23+/-6% and 20+/-6%, respectively) over the unstimulated, static controls. At four weeks, an increased amount of tissue formed (stimulated: 1.85+/-0.08, unstimulated: 1.58+/-0.07 mg dry wt.). This tissue contained approximately 40% more collagen (stimulated: 511+/-23, unstimulated: 367+/-24 microg/construct) and 35% more proteoglycans (stimulated: 376+/-21, unstimulated: 279+/-26 microg/construct). Tissues that formed in the presence of shearing forces also displayed a 3-fold increase in compressive load-bearing capacity (stimulated: 16+/-5, unstimulated: 5+/-1 kPa max. equilibrium stress) and a 6-fold increase in stiffness (stimulated: 112+/-36, unstimulated: 20+/-6 kPa max. equilibrium modulus) compared to the static controls. These results demonstrate that intermittent application of dynamic shearing forces over a four-week period improves the quality of cartilaginous tissue formed in vitro. Interestingly, low amplitudes of shear stimulation for short periods of time (6 min of stimulation applied every 2nd day) produced these changes.},

abstract = {The presence of an appropriate number of reparative cells in an articular cartilage defect is probably necessary for consistent and successful repair. Following the transplantation of chondrocytes into a defect, cell proliferation may modulate local defect cellularity. Transplanted cells can be compressed during cartilage repair as a result of joint-loading or press-fitting a graft into a cartilage defect. The objective of this study was to characterize the proliferative response of chondrocytes after attachment to cartilage and application of static compressive stress between cartilaginous surfaces in an ex vivo model. The chondrocytes were isolated from adult bovine cartilage, cultured in high-density monolayer, resuspended, and then transplanted onto the surface of devitalized cartilage at a density of 250,000 cells/cm2. The total DNA content of transplanted cell layers increased steadily to a plateau by 5 days and represented a 4-fold increase in cell number during incubation in medium including serum and ascorbate. Over the culture period, the level of DNA synthesis ([3H]thymidine incorporation), on a per cell basis, decreased steadily (88% between days 0 and 6). The application of 24 hours of static compressive stress (0.06-0.4 MPa) to the adherent cells at 1 and 4 days after transplantation inhibited overall DNA synthesis by 70-approximately 87% compared with unloaded controls. After release from load, cell proliferation generally remained at low levels. The marked proliferation of chondrocytes when attached to cartilage without applied load and the inhibition of this proliferation by relatively low-amplitude static compressive stress may be relevant to the occasional overgrowth of tissue in some chondrocyte transplantation procedures. The dosimetry of these effects suggests that the in vivo mechanical environment may have a marked effect on proliferation of transplanted chondrocytes.},

abstract = {The direct effects of hydrostatic pressure on matrix synthesis in articular cartilage can be studied independently of the other factors that change during loading. We have found that the influence of hydrostatic pressure on incorporation rates of 35SO4 and [3H]proline into adult bovine articular cartilage slices in vitro depends on the pressure level and on the time at pressure. Pressures in the "physiological" range (5-15 MPa) applied for 20 s or for 5 min could stimulate tracer incorporation (30-130%) during the following 2 h, but higher pressures (20-50 MPa) had no effect on incorporation rates. The degree of stimulation in cartilage obtained from different animals was found to vary; in some animals none was seen. Stimulation also varied with position along the joint. Physiological pressures (5-10 MPa) applied continuously for the 2-h incubation period also stimulated incorporation rates, but pressures greater than 20 MPa always produced a decrease that was related to the applied pressure and that was reversible. These results suggests that the hydrostatic pressure that occurs during loading is a signal that can stimulate matrix synthesis rates in articular cartilage.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To characterize the expression pattern of clusterin in adult human normal and osteoarthritic cartilage.

METHODS:Clusterin mRNA expression in adult human normal and osteoarthritic cartilage was investigated by analysis of cDNA libraries, TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR, microarray and in situ hybridization.

RESULTS:Sequence analysis of ESTs from adult human normal and osteoarthritic cartilage cDNA libraries demonstrated that the abundance of clusterin in these libraries was equivalent to genes which have been more commonly associated with cartilage. To examine tissue distribution, TaqMan Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using RNA from a panel of individual normal tissues. Clusterin was expressed at significant levels in cartilage, brain, liver, and pancreas. The expression of clusterin mRNA was up-regulated in early osteoarthritic vs normal cartilage when analysed by microarray analysis. Using in situ hybridization, chondrocytes of normal cartilage expressed moderate levels of clusterin. Upper mid-zone chondrocytes in cartilage with early stages of osteoarthritic disease expressed high levels of clusterin mRNA. In advanced osteoarthritic cartilage, the overall expression of clusterin was reduced.

CONCLUSION:The induction of clusterin has been associated with a variety of disease states where it appears to provide a cytoprotective effect. The increased expression of clusterin mRNA in the early stages of osteoarthritis (OA) may reflect an attempt by the chondrocytes to protect and repair the tissue. In contrast, the decrease in clusterin mRNA in the advanced osteoarthritic cartilage accompanies the final degenerative stages of the disease. An understanding of the expression of clusterin in osteoarthritis may allow consideration of this protein as a marker for cartilage changes in this chronic degenerative condition.},

In addition, both integrins and CD44 have the capacity for signal transduction as well as modulated interactions with the actin cytoskeleton. As such, both receptor families provide the chondrocytes a means to detect changes in matrix composition or to function as mechanotransducers. Disruption of CD44 or integrin-mediated cell-matrix interactions, either experimentally induced or when present in osteoarthritis, have profound effects on cartilage metabolism. Thus, CD44 and integrin receptors play a critical role in maintaining cartilage homeostasis.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage damage is a persistent and increasing problem with the aging population, and treatments to achieve biological repair or restoration remain a challenge. Cartilage tissue engineering approaches have been investigated for over 20 years, but have yet to achieve the consistency and effectiveness for widespread clinical use. One of the potential reasons for this is that the engineered tissues do not have or establish the normal zonal organization of cells and extracellular matrix that appears critical for normal tissue function. A number of approaches are being taken currently to engineer tissue that more closely mimics the organization of native articular cartilage. This review focuses on the zonal organization of native articular cartilage, strategies being used to develop such organization, the reorganization that occurs after culture or implantation, and future prospects for the tissue engineering of articular cartilage with biomimetic zones.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage plays a vital role in joint morphology. An understanding of articular cartilage anatomy and physiology will enable the physician to more fully appreciate its function and necessity. Articular cartilage is made up of four basic biological layers or zones. Each zone possesses attributes necessary to make articular cartilage as a whole strong, durable, and more able to withstand shear and axial forces through a joint. Cartilage metabolism is relatively slow in comparison with other tissues; hence, it is much more difficult for defects in cartilage to heal spontaneously. There are many ways in which articular cartilage can incur damage. Mechanical injury, be it acute or insidious, causes cartilage to fissure and fracture. This results in painful and inflamed joints along with disruption of the cartilage. Metabolic diseases also can produce joint destruction, inflammation, and pain. The resultant defects fail to heal spontaneously because of slow metabolism of cartilage. These chondral defects eventually may penetrate subchondral bone. Disruption of the layers of cartilage eventually will cause collapse and loss of integrity of the entire joint apparatus as a whole. More than 250 years ago, Hunter stated, Ulcerated cartilage is a troublesome thing--once [it is] destroyed it is not repaired. Articular cartilage defects are very difficult to repair effectively. Cartilage defects can heal spontaneously, if the defect extends to subchondral bone. The reparative substance, fibrocartilage, is less durable and much less smooth. There are many techniques and procedures in which chondral or osteochondral defects can be filled. Promoting subchondral bleeding is the method most commonly used clinically. This allows pleuripotent cells to fill the defect with eventual fibrocartilage. Implants are gaining favor as a method of inducing a more pure, hyaline-like cartilage into cartilage defects. Gene therapy and tissue engineering are at the forefront of cartilage research today. Cartilage injury and repair remains today a very difficult topic of study. Understanding the anatomy of articular cartilage, the pathomechanics of injury, and methods available for cartilage repair, will help the physician more adequately approach treatment options.},

A heterogeneous distribution of viable cells and functional matrix within the developing tissue is a common consequence. In the present study, a bioreactor was developed to perfuse fluid through cylindrical agarose constructs. The transport and distribution of dextran molecules (FD-4, FD-500, FD-2000) within the agarose was visualized in order to determine the bioreactors effectiveness for transport enhancement. By 24 h, the perfusion bioreactor achieved 529%, 395% and 294% higher concentrations of FD-4, FD-500 and FD-2000, respectively, than those solely due to diffusion. Of particular interest was the effectiveness of the bioreactor to transport molecules to the central region of the constructs. In this respect, the perfusion bioreactor was found to increase transportation of FD-4, FD-500 and FD-2000 by 30%, 291% and 222% over that of diffusion. Articular chondrocytes were cultured and perfused using the bioreactor. The improved molecular transport achieved led to an average 75% and 1340% increase of DNA and sulphated GAG, respectively at 20 days. More significantly was the 106% and 1603% increase of DNA and GAG, respectively, achieved at the central core of the 3D constructs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Articular cartilage is a highly functional tissue which covers the ends of long bones and serves to ensure proper joint movement. A tissue engineering approach that recapitulates the developmental characteristics of articular cartilage can be used to examine the maturation and degeneration of cartilage and produce fully functional neotissue replacements for diseased tissue.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:This study examined the development of articular cartilage neotissue within a self-assembling process in two phases. In the first phase, articular cartilage constructs were examined at 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days immunohistochemically, histologically, and through biochemical analysis for total collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content. Based on statistical changes in GAG and collagen levels, four time points from the first phase (7, 14, 28, and 56 days) were chosen to carry into the second phase, where the constructs were studied in terms of their mechanical characteristics, relative amounts of collagen types II and VI, and specific GAG types (chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronan). Collagen type VI was present in initial abundance and then localized to a pericellular distribution at 4 wks. N-cadherin activity also spiked at early stages of neotissue development, suggesting that self-assembly is mediated through a minimization of free energy. The percentage of collagen type II to total collagen significantly increased over time, while the proportion of collagen type VI to total collagen decreased between 1 and 2 wks. The chondroitin 6- to 4- sulfate ratio decreased steadily during construct maturation. In addition, the compressive properties reached a plateau and tensile characteristics peaked at 4 wks.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:The indices of cartilage formation examined in this study suggest that tissue maturation in self-assembled articular cartilage mirrors known developmental processes for native tissue. In terms of tissue engineering, it is suggested that exogenous stimulation may be necessary after 4 wks to further augment the functionality of developing constructs.},

Single chondrocytes and chondrons were compressed between two parallel surfaces by a micromanipulation technique to investigate their biomechanical properties and to discover the mechanical significance of the PCM. The force imposed on the cells was measured directly during deformation at various compression speeds and deformations up to cell rupture. When the deformation at the end of compression was 50%, relaxation showed that the cells were viscoelastic, but this viscoelasticity was generally insignificant at 30% deformation or lower. When the deformation was 70%, the cells had deformed plastically. Chondrons ruptured at a mean deformation of 85 +/- 1%, whilst chondrocytes ruptured at a mean deformation of 78 +/- 1%. Chondrons were generally stiffer than chondrocytes and showed less viscoelastic behaviour than chondrocytes. Thus, the PCM significantly influences the mechanical properties of the cells.},

abstract = {The effect of dynamic mechanical shear and compression on the synthesis of human tissue-engineered cartilage was investigated using a mechanobioreactor capable of simulating the rolling action of articular joints in a mixed fluid environment. Human chondrocytes seeded into polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh or PGA-alginate scaffolds were precultured in shaking T-flasks or recirculation perfusion bioreactors for 2.5 or 4 weeks prior to mechanical stimulation in the mechanobioreactor. Constructs were subjected to intermittent unconfined shear and compressive loading at a frequency of 0.05 Hz using a peak-to-peak compressive strain amplitude of 2.2% superimposed on a static axial compressive strain of 6.5%. The mechanical treatment was carried out for up to 2.5 weeks using a loading regime of 10 min duration each day with the direction of the shear forces reversed after 5 min and release of all loading at the end of the daily treatment period. Compared with shaking T-flasks and mechanobioreactor control cultures without loading, mechanical treatment improved the amount and quality of cartilage produced. On a per cell basis, synthesis of both major structural components of cartilage, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen type II, was enhanced substantially by up to 5.3- and 10-fold, respectively, depending on the scaffold type and seeding cell density. Levels of collagen type II as a percentage of total collagen were also increased after mechanical treatment by up to 3.4-fold in PGA constructs. Mechanical treatment had a less pronounced effect on the composition of constructs precultured in perfusion bioreactors compared with perfusion culture controls. This work demonstrates that the quality of tissue-engineered cartilage can be enhanced significantly by application of simultaneous dynamic mechanical shear and compression, with the greatest benefits evident for synthesis of collagen type II.

abstract = {The three-dimensional architecture of bovine articular cartilage collagen and its relationship to split lines has been studied with scanning electron microscopy. In the middle and superficial zones, collagen was organised in a layered or leaf-like manner. The orientation was vertical in the intermediate zone, curving to become horizontal and parallel to the articular surface in the superficial zone. Each leaf consisted of a fine network of collagen fibrils. Adjacent leaves merged or were closely linked by bridging fibrils and were arranged according to the split-line pattern. The surface layer (lamina splendens) was morphologically distinct. Although ordered, the overall collagen structure was different in each plane (anisotropic) a property described in previous morphological and biophysical studies. As all components of the articular cartilage matrix interact closely, the three-dimensional organisation of collagen is important when considering cartilage function and the processes of cartilage growth, injury and repair.},

abstract = {Cartilage injury remains a major challenge in orthopedic surgery due to the fact that articular cartilage has only a limited capacity for intrinsic healing. Cartilage impaction is followed by a post-traumatic inflammatory response. Chondrocytes and synoviocytes are activated to produce inflammatory mediators and degradative enzymes which can induce a progradient cartilage self-destruction finally leading to secondary osteoarthritis (OA). However, an anti-inflammatory compensatory response is also detectable in cartilage by up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, probably a temporary attempt by chondrocytes to restore cartilage homeostasis. Matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) is a suitable technique for improving the rate of repair of larger articular cartilage defects. For MACT, autologous chondrocytes were isolated from a cartilage biopsy of a non-load bearing joint area. This technique requires sufficient expansion of differentiated autologous chondrocytes, which were then seeded on suitable biodegradable three-dimensional (3D) matrices to preform an extracellular cartilage matrix (ECM) before implantation into the defect. Cell expansion is accompanied by chondrocyte dedifferentiation, whereby substantial changes occur at multiple levels of chondrocyte synthetic profiles: including the ECM, cell surface receptors and cytoskeletal proteins. Since these dedifferentiated chondrocytes produce a non-specific mechanically inferior ECM, they are not suitable for MACT. 3D cultures are means of inducing and maintaining chondrocyte (re)differentiation and to preform ECM. The combination of MACT with anabolic growth factors and anti-inflammatory strategies using anti-inflammatory mediators might be useful for stabilizing the differentiated chondrocyte phenotype, to support neocartilage formation and inhibit post-traumatic cartilage inflammation and hence, the development of secondary OA.},

These include cardiac, lung, craniofacial, limb, spinal column, eye, inner ear and urogenital defects. The developmental processes most commonly involved in the affected tissues include epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, cell growth, extracellular matrix production and tissue remodeling. In addition, many affected tissues have neural crest-derived components and simulate neural crest deficiencies.

abstract = {A key property of neural systems is their ability to adapt selectively to stimuli with different features. Using multisite electrical recordings from networks of cortical neurons developing ex vivo, we show that neurons adapt selectively to different stimuli invading the network. We focus on selective adaptation to frequent and rare stimuli; networks were stimulated at two sites with two different stimulus frequencies. When both stimuli were presented within the same period, neurons in the network attenuated their responsiveness to the more frequent input, whereas their responsiveness to the rarely delivered stimuli showed a marked average increase. The amplification of the response to rare stimuli required the presence of the other, more frequent stimulation source. By contrast, the decreased response to the frequent stimuli occurred regardless of the presence of the rare stimuli. Analysis of the response of single units suggests that both of these effects are caused by changes in synaptic transmission. By using synaptic blockers, we find that the increased responsiveness to the rarely stimulated site depends specifically on fast GABAergic transmission. Thus, excitatory synaptic depression, the inhibitory sub-network, and their balance play an active role in generating selective gain control. The observation that selective adaptation arises naturally in a network of cortical neurons developing ex vivo indicates that this is an inherent feature of spontaneously organizing cortical networks.},

For both static and bioreactor culture, agarose constructs contained more glycosaminoglycan than their PGA counterparts. However, the PGA constructs contained more collagen for both culture conditions when compared to agarose. For the low seeding density of this study, PGA constructs cultured in the bioreactor did not outperform static cultures when comparing collagen content after 8 weeks. The mechanical properties of the PGA constructs also did not improve with culture time. Similar results were observed with the agarose culture, though both static- and bioreactor-culture agarose constructs exhibited increases in aggregate modulus at the end of the culture period. As in PGA culture, chondrocytes cultured in agarose may require a higher density to reap the benefits of the bioreactor environment.},

In the absence of FBS, the cells remain viable only when seeded at high densities. They do not proliferate at a high rate but they deposit extracellular matrix with fibrils resembling those of authentic embryonic cartilage in their appearance and collagen composition. The cells exhibit many morphological and biochemical characteristics of resting chondrocytes and they do not produce collagen X, a marker for hypertrophic cartilage undergoing endochondral ossification. At low density, cells survive in culture without FBS when the media are conditioned by chondrocytes grown at high density. Thus, resting cartilage cells in agarose cultures can produce factors required for their own viability. Addition of FBS to the culture media leads to profound changes in the phenotype of chondrocytes seeded at low density. Cells form colonies at a high rate and assume properties of hypertrophic cells, including the synthesis of collagen X. They extensively deposit extracellular matrix resembling more closely that of adult rather than embryonic cartilage.},
